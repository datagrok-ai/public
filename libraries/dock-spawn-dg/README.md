# dock-spawn-ts

A TypeScript Version of dock-spawn (see https://github.com/coderespawn/dock-spawn) with changes for Datagrok.
Changes:

- Webcomponent interacts properly with Vue's renderer
- Webcomponent emits proper events on panel closing
- Panels could not be turned into dialogs. They dock by "filling" strategy by default
