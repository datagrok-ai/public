# Datagrok API Overview

Datagrok provides two primary types of APIs: JavaScript and Python. Each of these APIs allows you to interact with the Datagrok 
platform for various tasks, such as data processing, groups management, and more.

## API Types

- [JavaScript API](js/index.md): The JavaScript API is designed for use with Datagrok plugins.
- [Python API](py/index.md): The Python API is ideal for data science and automation tasks, providing easy integration with Datagrok services from a Python environment.

Both APIs offer extensive functionality and are continually updated to include new features.
