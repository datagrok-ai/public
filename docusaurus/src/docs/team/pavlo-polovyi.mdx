<Card meta={meta}>

With years of experience as an R&D chemist,I come from a pharmaceutical world where I contributed to the development of new drugs. While chemistry has always been close to my heart, my interest in technology nudged me to pick up coding alongside my day job. Now, as a Software Engineer, I've found a fulfilling intersection of these two passions. I'm just setting out on this new journey, and I'm thrilled to be part of the Datagrok family.

For me, effective team communication is the backbone of successful work. That's why I like working with people who are straightforward, accountable, and genuinely excited about the tasks at hand.
