<Card meta={meta}>

I am a Scientific Application Developer for life sciences. My background is in Computer Science. My journey with software development began in middle school when I first tried coding in C++. Since then, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge, writing code in multiple languages, including C++, Python, Java, C#, and Typescript. .

I am inspired by the potential of software to make a lasting impact on the world. One of my most challenging and rewarding projects to date is the creation of ADME calculators. Though it’s an ambitious and challenging undertaking and while there is still much work to be done before the app will be released in production, it is gratifying to know that I am contributing to the discovery of new drugs.

In my free time, I continue to educate myself and improve my skills. I also enjoy choreography and learning new languages.

Datagrok is more than just a team; it's a family. To be a part of this team, you need to be responsive, have a strong desire to learn and grow, and be willing to tackle challenging projects that bring value to the world.
