<Card meta={meta}>

I have a strong technical background, with a decade of experience in
physico-chemical research before transitioning to IT. My Ph.D. in Colloid
Chemistry fueled my passion for data analysis, problem-solving, and uncovering
patterns in complex systems. Over time, I realized that the tools used for
scientific research often lacked efficiency and usability, which sparked my
interest in technology and led me to the world of software development and
quality assurance.

At Datagrok, I work as a QA engineer, ensuring the platform is reliable,
efficient, and user-friendly. Having spent years in research, I understand the
importance of intuitive and powerful tools for data exploration. Being part of a
team that helps scientists push the boundaries of discovery is both
inspiring and rewarding.
