Datagrok is a next-generation analytics platform built from first principles to
unify data, compute, and scientific workflows in the browser. Enterprises use
Datagrok to run complex analytics at scale - across chemistry, biology, clinical
research, and beyond.

We need someone who will become an expert on the platform - documenting it,
testing it, teaching it, and enabling customers to use it effectively.

This is a hybrid role at the intersection of engineering, QA, technical writing,
and customer enablement. It starts technical and becomes customer-facing as you
grow.


## What you'll do

This role is structured in two phases. You'll first learn and master the
platform by writing, testing, and building with it. Once confident, you'll
evolve into the person who helps customers understand, adopt, and get the most
out of Datagrok.

### Phase 1 (months 1-6): platform mastery

Learn the platform deeply:

* Work across technical writing, QA, and light development
* Learn Datagrok's capabilities, JS/TS API, plugins, and workflows
* Create and maintain technical assets: docs, code samples, tutorials, and videos
* Lead QA and manage 2 manual QA engineers
* Design and execute test strategies (manual + automation)
* Develop repeatable test plans for platform features, APIs, and workflows
* Identify and fix gaps in documentation, UX, and quality

### Phase 2 (months 6+): customer enablement

Take on customer-facing responsibilities once platform-proficient:

* Provide first-line technical support: answer questions, triage issues, guide users
* Prepare responses for RFPs, RFIs, and customer FAQs
* Update docs based on customer feedback
* Act as the voice of the customer inside the company
* Own and refine the customer onboarding experience
* Deliver customer training sessions and product demos

## Requirements

**Must have**:
* Strong junior-to-mid-level JavaScript/TypeScript skills
* Fluent English (C1+), excellent written and spoken communication
* 2+ years leading QA efforts (manual + automation), including test strategy design
* Ability to learn complex systems and understand architecture
* Ability to explain technical concepts clearly to developers, scientists, and business users
* Strong user-oriented mindset
* System-level thinking: spots gaps in docs, tests, UX

**Nice to have**:
* Background in UX/UI or a strong eye for clarity and structure
* Experience with scientific or life-science software
* Prior customer-facing technical role (Solutions Engineer, Technical Account Manager, etc.)

## Why this role is unique
* You'll get a 360° view of a cutting-edge scientific analytics ecosystem
* You will become one of the most knowledgeable users of Datagrok
* You'll work across engineering, QA, docs, product, UX, and customer success
* You'll shape how teams and customers learn and adopt Datagrok

If you want to build, test, teach, and enable - all in one role - we'd love to talk.
