Location: Remote | Start: ASAP

While others talk about revolutionizing drug discovery, we’re doing it. We've
built a platform that runs UMAP on hundreds of thousands of molecules in
seconds, not hours. Our users interactively explore the chemical space on the
entire ChEMBL database, perform complex operations like substructure searches,
and collaborate on ideas  - all in a web browser. 

We handle everything - from data access and visualization to advanced ML/AI for
ADMET profiling. We're leveraging WebAssembly and WebGPU to push browser
capabilities to their limits, and CUDA and other tech on the server side.

## Role overview

As a scientific application developer, you’ll build scientific applications
using JavaScript/TypeScript with the Datagrok JS API, focusing on
cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and high-performance computing solutions.
You'll work with a global team serving top scientists in drug discovery.

## Responsibilities

* Develop front-end scientific applications and back-end integrations
* Design and implement data management systems
* Support clients in building JS/TS applications on our platform
* Expand platform capabilities through new plugins
* Integrate and optimize third-party libraries

## Requirements

* 3+ years of development experience
* Strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills
* Background or experience in life sciences (bioinformatics, cheminformatics, or drug development)
* Good English
* Track record of delivering high-performance code
* Proven ability to learn complex scientific concepts quickly

## Nice to have

* Experience with Python, R, Java, C#, C++, or Matlab
* Knowledge of WebGL, WebAssembly, or Dart
* High-performance computing background
* Expertise in creating intuitive scientific interfaces
* Algorithm optimization experience

## Why join us?

* Minimal bureaucracy, maximum impact
* Freedom to organize your work
* Challenging problems with real-world implications
* Collaboration with experts across multiple disciplines
* Continuous learning in cutting-edge tech and science
* Contributions to open source and democratization of data science

## Stand out from the crowd
