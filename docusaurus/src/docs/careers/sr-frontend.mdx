We're building the most advanced browser-based analytics platform in life
sciences â€” where WebAssembly, WebGPU, AI, and scientific computing meet elegant
design. 
The browser is our performance frontier and creative canvas. 
Join us to push the limits of what the web can do and shape the next generation of
interfaces for scientific discovery.

## The challenge

**Datagrok** is both a ready-to-use platform for exploratory data analysis and a
foundation for building applications on top of it - think an _operating system_
for life sciences.

For UI, we use our own lightweight library, and it has served us really well,
unlocking the best performance of [interactive visualizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67LzPsdNrEc), letting scientists
build powerful UIs in a few lines using our [JS API](https://datagrok.ai/api/js), and enabling developers
to build rich UI across [50+ plugins](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages).

Now we're taking our UX toolkit and platform experience to the next level. We
want to keep the ability to write lightweight, expressive code, and at the same
time, we want new frontend developers to be productive on
day 1 using popular technologies (maybe React), have dynamically discoverable
and configurable components, LLMs to produce the UX based on user prompts, and
more.

We're not rewriting the core - we want a technology that would simplify creating
UI in apps, plugins, and scripts. And along the way, we'll be creating cool
high-performance scientific applications on that stack!

## What you'll do

This is an individual contributor role with significant ownership and decision-making authority.

* Enable 90% of polished UIs to be built in pure JavaScript (no HTML or CSS) in lightweight (no-dependency, no-preprocessing) scripts
* Decide whether to evolve our JavaScript API or adopt a framework (React/Vue/etc.), styles (Tailwind), preprocessor (SASS), and/or component library
* Build wrappers for the Datagrok components and expose as widgets using the library of choice
* Develop the component model for widget registration, discovery, and configuration
* Create intuitive UIs for customizing components, binding data, and handling events
* Implement a visual designer with a drag-and-drop palette of dynamically loaded widgets
* Evolve the JavaScript API to be fast, stable, and well-documented
* Build scientific applications using the UX framework
* Build prototypes that showcase platform capabilities and improve UX based on feedback
* Head the front-end development, establish guidelines, mentor, do PRs, etc.


## Requirements

### Must have

* **5+ years of front-end development** (but ability matters more than years)
* Strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills and experience building complex web applications
* Expertise with modern frameworks (React, Vue, or similar)
* Experience building reusable component libraries or design systems
* Proven ability to create polished, intuitive interfaces users love
* Efficient, performant code for data-intensive applications
* Strong problem-solving skills, ability to work independently, and get stuff done quickly

### Nice to have

* **UX/UI design background** or strong aesthetic sense
* **Game development experience** (demonstrates ability to create engaging, interactive experiences)
* Experience with data visualization libraries and techniques
* Full-stack development skills (Java, Python, R, or other languages)
* Experience with high-performance web applications or scientific computing
* Background in natural sciences, STEM, or scientific software


## You're the ideal candidate if you

* Think in systems - building frameworks that empower others to create
* Care deeply about developer experience and elegant architecture
* Thrive in small, autonomous teams where decisions have immediate impact
* Enjoy solving challenging technical problems at the intersection of performance and design
* Get excited about pushing browser capabilities (WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebGL)
* Have a portfolio that makes us say, "wow - we need this person"


We value ability over checkboxes. If you can demonstrate you can deliver -
through experience, portfolio, or projects - we want to hear from you. 

**To apply**: include portfolio links, GitHub, or demos showcasing your best UI work.
