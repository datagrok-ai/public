- Help refactor existing infrastructure to make it more reliable, secure, and efficient
- Troubleshoot and resolve deployment and production issues
- Write manifests and deploy them on a cluster
- Write scripts in Bash or Python. You will also support our internal Python-based application for initializing containers
- Maintain and improve our monitoring system using Prometheus and CloudWatch

## Requirements

You can:

- Thrive in an asynchronous, remote environment

- May or may not like writing tests but do it anyway if the team or project needs it
- Take pride in your work and have a product (customer-centric) mentality
