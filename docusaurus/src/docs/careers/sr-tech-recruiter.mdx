Location: Remote (GMT to GMT+3, minimum 4-hour EST overlap required) | Start: ASAP

**We are not looking for a checkbox recruiter.** 

This role is about building Datagrok through exceptional people. You'll be a
visible representative of our company - someone who understands our product,
believes in what we're building, and advocates for it authentically.

We are building a data analysis platform for problems that genuinely matter -
discovering new drugs and advancing scientific breakthroughs. The product is
complex, the technical bar is high, and the problems are hard. We're not
iterating on existing tools. We're building something fundamentally more
capable.

Hiring well requires more than keyword matching. You should recognize strong
talent even when the background, stack, or career path doesn't fit conventional
patterns or job descriptions. We don't need volume. Success means moving a small
number of highly relevant, well-vetted candidates forward - people who can
genuinely thrive at Datagrok.

This role is for someone who enjoys wearing multiple hats, takes ownership of
outcomes, and is technically strong to engage deeply with candidates.

## Key responsibilities

In addition to core recruiting (sourcing, screening, and closing candidates
across Ukraine, Europe, and other regions), you will:

* develop a strong understanding of our product and tech stack to identify great
  candidates across roles and geographies
* partner with the team to understand product evolution, refine candidate
  profiles, and continuously improve how we screen for technical ability and
  culture fit
* represent Datagrok at technical conferences, meetups, hackathons, and industry
  events (online and in-person)
* build and grow relationships with universities, student groups, research labs,
  engineering communities, etc.
* initiate and lead employer-brand initiatives - from organizing hackathons and
  tech talks to creating engaging content like AMAs, role walkthroughs, or
  behind-the-scenes videos that authentically communicate what working at
  Datagrok is really like

## What we're looking for

As a visible face of Datagrok, you must embody our values in every candidate
interaction. Your interpersonal skills matter as much as your technical skills.

**Must-have skills**
* 5+ years of technical recruiting experience, with a track record of hiring
  senior technical roles
* ability to hold credible technical conversations across multiple stacks - with
  enough depth to evaluate competency and role fit, even without being a
  developer yourself
* experience recruiting across multiple geographies and conducting effective
  interviews in English
* comfort with ambiguity and a strong sense of independent ownership
* self-starter mentality with demonstrated creative sourcing initiatives

**Bonus points**
* hands-on coding or software development experience
* background in psychology or behavioral sciences
* experience organizing or speaking at technical events
* existing relationships in technical communities

If you believe you would thrive in this role (even without checking every box),
we want to hear from you.

## Why join us?
* Own and shape talent strategy in a fast-growing company with a unique product
  that genuinely matters
* Remote-friendly, high-trust culture with minimal bureaucracy
* Collaboration with experts across multiple disciplines
* Continuous learning in cutting-edge tech and science

## Stand out from the crowd

Want to make a strong first impression? Consider submitting a short video
introduction (2-3 minutes) with your application. Tell us who you are, how you
think about recruiting, and why this role resonates with you.
