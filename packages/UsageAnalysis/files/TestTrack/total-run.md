# Test Track — Global Report

**Date**: 2026-04-23
**Legend**: 🟢 improvement/pass · 🔴 regression/fail · 🟡 partial/ambiguous/new-missing-delta · ⚪ no change / no data
**Verdict**: Conditionally ready

## Column definitions

- **Pass %** — `(pass + 0.5·partial) / total_steps` from each run's `## Steps` section.
- **Browser** — MCP phase wall-clock = model thinking time + live browser interaction time.
- **Spec Gen** — model-only time to generate the Playwright spec.
- **Spec Run** — Playwright-only spec execution time.
- **Total** (per test) — sum of Browser + Spec Gen + Spec Run for that scenario. **Mean Total** = average of those sums.
- **Pass Δ (1d)** — Pass % change vs. `prev1d` (the most recent committed `total-run.md` strictly before today).
- **Pass Δ (7d)** — Pass % change vs. `prev7d` (the committed `total-run.md` closest to today − 7 days, ±3-day window). Empty when no commit falls in that window.
- **Trend** — last ≤7 daily Pass % values, oldest → newest, dot-separated. Prefix icon: 🟢 last > first, 🔴 last < first, ⚪ equal or only one point.

## Comparison with Previous Reports

Deltas are computed against two baselines pulled from git history of `total-run.md`: `prev1d` (latest commit before today) and `prev7d` (commit closest to today − 7 days, ±3-day window). Signed with `+`/`-`; time deltas use the same format as the values. All status and delta cells carry the Legend icons.

### Per-Test Changes

Lists tests where Pass % (1d or 7d), status, or any timing component changed vs. either baseline — plus persistent-failure rows where Pass % is still < 100% even with a flat Δ. Tests at a clean 100% with no timing change are omitted.
