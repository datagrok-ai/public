    2. Check the **Misc** > **Mouse Drag** (Pan or Select) setting
    3. Go to the scatter **plot > Property Pane > Misc**. Check the **Lasso Tool** checkbox. Use it on the scatter plot. Check the selection in the grid.
    4. Select some points. Use Ctrl+Shift+Drag for deselection.
10. Tooltip:
    1. Right-click the scatter plot and check all options on the **Tooltip** tab.
    2. Save to Layout. Check
    3. Go to Property Pane > Tooltip. Check all options.
    4. Save to Layout. Check
11. Formula lines (dataframe lines, viewer-specific lines):
    1. Right-click the scatter plot and select **Tools > Formula Lines.** A **Formula Lines** editor opens. Click the ADD NEW button and select every option from the menu.
    2. Check the Viewer and Dataframe tabs (Viewer -- you see it only on he current viewer, DF -- All DF viewers)
    3. Save to Layout. Check (only viewer formula lines are saved)
    4. Delete created lines.
12. Using structures as axes:
    1. Change the X axis to Structure. Check the visibility of the structures.
    2. Save to Layout. Check
13. Interaction with Filter Panel:
    1. Go to **Tables** and click the **Filter** icon
    2. Right-click a cell in the `Structure` column
    3. Select **Current value > Use as filter** from the context menu. Check the **Filter Panel** and the scatter plot.
    4. Change arbitrary settings on the **Filter Panel** and check the scatter plot interaction.
    5. Save to Layout. Check
14. Verify Table Filtering Behavior with Empty Column on Log Scale Axis in Scatter Plot
* Open a dataset that includes at least one numerical column with no values (e.g., all entries in the column are null or NaN). For example, use fruits_.csv for the test.
* Add a scatter plot viewer to the dataset. Set the scatter plotâ€™s zoom and filter setting to "Filter by zoom." Select the empty numerical column for one of the axes (X or Y). Change the axis to a log scale.
* Check the scatter plot: Since the axis is set to log scale and the column has no values, the scatter plot should display no data points.
* Check Table Filtering: Examine the table after configuring the scatter plot. 
Expected Result: The scatter plot should display no data points, but the table should remain unfiltered, displaying all original data rows. 
15. Verify that Scatterplot ignores negatives and zero values when switching to log scale ([#2456](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/2456)):
- Switch axes to the log scale
- Try to set categorical axis to the X
16. Colour picker in legend. (Verify that the color picker in the legend of the Scatterplot works correctly, including opening, color changes, and maintaining previous selections across categories.)
- Assign any column to the Color on the Scatterplot to open legend. Check the color picker (an icon with a pen, appears when you hower over the legend). 
- Click the color picker icon. Main features are:
  - Pressing color picker opens color changind window (check for structure colunms as well). 
  - Change the Color of a Category: In the color picker, select a new color for a category.
Expected Result: The category color updates on the legend and Scatterplot.
  - Cancel Color Change: Reopen the color picker and select a different color. Press the "Cancel" button in the color picker window. Expected Result: The original color is restored, and no change is applied.
  - Maintain Previously Selected Colors: Select a new color for another category using the color picker. Expected Result: The color of the previously modified category remains unchanged.
