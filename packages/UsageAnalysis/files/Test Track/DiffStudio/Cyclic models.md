### Cyclic Models in Diff Studio

1. Open **Diff Studio** and Load **PK-PD Model**:
* Go to Apps and run **Diff Studio**.
* Click on the Open model icon on the ribbon.
* Select Library > **PK-PD** to load the cyclic model.
2. Check that both *Multiaxis* and *Facet* plots are updated.
3. Modify Count Input:
* In the PK-PD model, locate the Count input.
* Use the **clickers** to modify the Count value. Observe the solution changes in real-time as the Count input is modified.
4. Check **Tooltips** of the Begin, End, Step inputs. Hover over various input fields in the PK-PD model. Verify that tooltips are displayed correctly, providing relevant information for each input.

**Expected Results**: The PK-PD model should load successfully without any errors. Modifying the Count input should dynamically update the solution in real-time. The solution must reflect the changes without delay or errors. Tooltips should appear when hovering over input fields, displaying appropriate information related to the inputs.
