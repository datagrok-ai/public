### Stages in Diff Studio

1. Open **Diff Studio** and Load **Acid Production**:
* Go to Apps and run **Diff Studio**.
* Click on the Open model icon on the ribbon.
* Select Examples > **Acid Production** to load the cyclic model.
2. Modify inputs:
* Use the **clickers** or simply change numbers to modify the values. Observe the solution changes in real-time.
3. Check **Tooltips** of Inputs. Hover over various input fields in the Acid Production model. Verify that tooltips are displayed correctly, providing relevant information for each input.

**Expected Results**: The Acid Production model should load successfully without any errors. Modifying the Count input should dynamically update the solution in real-time. The solution must reflect the changes without delay or errors. Tooltips should appear when hovering over input fields, displaying appropriate information related to the inputs.
