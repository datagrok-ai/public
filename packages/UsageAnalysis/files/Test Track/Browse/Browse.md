1. Open Browse
2. Check all the items in Browse tree (Click item and check the Browse view and the Context Panel)
2. Run all Open API samples 
3. Thorough testing of all Demos (now integrated into the Browse section). Each demo should be displayed without any visible bugs or errors, and there should be no errors in the console. 
- Always check double-click opening (on Demo main text itself and on all demos)
- Demo opens if you open the demo app (not only from browse)
4. Copy the URL and open it in a new tab - the same entity should be opened.
5. Test browse refresh: Refreshing browse should ‘remember’ preview.
