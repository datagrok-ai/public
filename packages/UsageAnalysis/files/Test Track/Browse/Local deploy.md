### Local deploy

To verify the successful local deployment of the platform, ensuring that resources and packages are detected and installed correctly, and that API Tests can be run manually.

1. Deploy Platform Locally

Perform the platform deployment locally. Use the [link](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/admin/docker-compose) provided for the initial setup. Confirm that the deployment completes without errors.

2. Open Platform URL

After deployment, open the platform in a web browser by navigating to the following URL: http://localhost:8080.
Ensure that the platform loads correctly without any issues.

3. Proceed with the initial setup. Verify that all required resources are detected correctly without any issues.

4. Check that packages are installed from the initial setup step.

5. Install Dev Tools and API Tests Package. Ensure that the installation completes without errors.

6. Run API Tests ьanually through the Test Manager. Monitor the test execution and ensure that all tests pass without any failures.

**Expected Results:**
The platform should deploy locally without errors and be accessible via http://localhost:8080. Initial setup should detect all required resources correctly. "Dev Tools" and "API Tests" packages should install without issues. API Tests should run successfully with all tests passing.
