1. Open tables from different sources:

   * Table from a file share
   * Table from Space
   * Table from a database
   * Table from a Query
   * Table generated by a Script
   * Add tables via  Pivot Table > Add, Data > Aggregate Rows > Add
   * Join two tables (DB table + query result)
   * Clone a table opened from a script
1. Save all opened tables as a project with Data Sync enabled
1. Open tables from:
   * Spaces
   * Files
   * Query result
   * DB table
1. Add newly opened tables to the opened project (drag'n'drop them in the Dashboards)
1. Open the project and save a copy without Data Sync for all tables
1. Open the copied project and save it again with Data Sync enabled  
(result: two projects, both with Data Sync).
1. Open the last saved project and rename all tables inside it. 
1. Save a copy of the project with Data Sync enabled.
1. Rename the following entities:
   * Project
   * Query
   * Script
1. Move the following entities to any file share, then to any Space:
   * Script
   * Query
   * Project
1. Open the moved project and previously saved project and verify:
   * All tables are available
   * Table relationships are preserved
   * Data Sync updates correctly 
1. Configure project sharing for another user with:
   * View and Use access
   * Full access
1. Log in as the second user and open the shared project.

**Expected result:**

* All entities function correctly after renaming and moving.
* Data Sync updates as expected.
* Users with different access levels see the project and its contents according to their permissions.
