#### Verify All Applications in "Browse > Apps" Section

Ensure all applications, especially "Demos," open without errors or visual glitches and perform as expected with proper interactivity.

Precondition:
- Navigate to Browse > Apps. The Apps section loads without errors.

1. Run All Applications. (Demos and Tutorials should be on the top of the list)
- Open each application one by one (except Tutorials).
- Expected Result: All applications launch without errors. No visual glitches or layout issues are present.

2. Focus on "Demo" applications and test Demo interactivity:
- In Browse > Demos, open each demo application. Each demo loads properly and displays its content correctly.
- For each demo:
  - If it contains a grid or viewer, try interacting with it: Select different columns, cells, or points on charts.
  - Test interactivity across available components.
Expected Result: All interactive elements respond correctly (e.g., selected cells or points highlight properly). No errors or issues appears.
