### Platform startup time

#### Verify that the platform starts within an acceptable time frame (2–4 seconds).

- Close all running platform instances. 
- Start the platform from a fresh launch (cleared cache, new browser tab).
- Measure the time from the launch action to the point where the platform is ready for user interaction.
- **Expected Result**: The platform should load and become interactive within **2–4 seconds**.

Notes:
- Ignore minor loading of non-blocking background processes.
