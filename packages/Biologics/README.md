# Biologics

`Biologics` is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform.

The plugin deploys a PostgreSQL database with a schema for storing biologics data, including sequences, antibodies, linkers, drugs, ADCs (antibody-drug conjugates), and assay results. It also registers identifiers for these entities.

Note: This package is for demo purposes only and is not intended for production use.
