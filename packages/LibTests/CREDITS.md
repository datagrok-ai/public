## 2. Linked at runtime via the Datagrok platform (webpack externals)

These libraries are not bundled into LibTests's `dist/` — they are provided
once by the platform host and shared across all packages.

## 3. Docker container images (`dockerfiles/`)

None. LibTests does not ship a Docker image.

---

## 4. Development-only dependencies

Tools used during the build/test cycle (not in the runtime tree, not bundled):
the `datagrok-tools` CLI transitively pulls in `puppeteer-screen-recorder`,
which references `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` (LGPL-2.1) and
`@ffmpeg-installer/win32-x64` (GPLv3). These binaries are **not** redistributed
as part of the published LibTests plugin and impose no obligation on users of
the plugin.
