  "description": "DevTools is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform. Its purpose is to simplify and assist in the development of platform extensions. This is achieved through familiarizing developers with Datagrok's [object](https://datagrok.ai/help/overview/objects) model and providing them with reproducible code snippets that fit their data. This approach allows to explore the key functionality from the interface, learn by example, jump to the [documentation](https://datagrok.ai/help/) or [API](https://datagrok.ai/js-api/) reference in one click, and much more. It also helps focus on the problem you are trying to solve: you can interact with your data from the outset while some of the program's building blocks are generated for you.",
