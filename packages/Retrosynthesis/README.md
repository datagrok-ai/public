# Retrosynthesis

Works backward from a target molecule (the desired final product) to identify simpler,
commercially available starting materials and the synthetic reactions needed to reach the target. This plugin is powered by an integration with [AiZynthFinder](https://github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder), an open-source tool for retrosynthetic planning.

To use, click or sketch a molecule, and expand the "Retrosynthesis" context panel on the right:
