# Docking

The [Docking package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) 
is a plugin that integrates 
the [Autodock GPU](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/hpc/containers/autodock) utility
with the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform.

This package also provides a good example of Datagrok integration 
with external utilities.
You can find more in the 
[Datagrok Docker container howto](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/how-to/docker_containers).

## AutoDock

[Autodock](https://autodock.scripps.edu/)
is widely used software for ligand-receptor docking 
that allows researchers to predict the binding interactions between small molecules (ligands) and macromolecule 
(receptor). 
The **Autodock-GPU** is a GPU-accelerated version of the Autodock software.

### How To

Setting up docking configurations can be challenging, but we've streamlined the process. Usually, someone familiar with the docking tool, like a cheminformatician, manages the complexity by identifying a pocket, preparing a configuration using the desktop Autodock application, naming it, and saving it on a server under the targets folder.

#### Prepare macromolecule (target)

Docking plugin contains several pre-created [targets](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Docking/files/targets).
To add your own macromolecule to the list of targets,
prepare the macromolecule using 
[AutoDock tools](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/downloads/).
You require the macromolecule in the `PDBQT` format 
and Autodock grid parameter file.
Review the Autodock tutorials
([first](https://www.chem.uwec.edu/chem491_w01/Chem491-Molecules%20and%20Medicine%202008/AutoDock%20Tutorial.pdf),
[second](https://omicstutorials.com/a-comprehensive-bioinformatics-tutorial-mastering-ligand-protein-docking-with-autodock/))
for the details.

Put these files in a folder under **System:AppData/Docking/targets**.
The folder make will be the name of your target in the Datagrok plugin UI.

**Atomic maps note:**

The autodock calculation fails if for a particular ligand 
corresponding atomic maps not available.
To run docking on a big ligand dataset, we suggest including all available atomic map types:
`A C HD N NA OA SA CL`.


#### Prepare data

Create or load a dataframe containing the ligands to be docked. 
For demonstration purposes, consider using the provided demo data located under 
**System:AppData/Docking/demo_files**.

#### Run docking

1. Navigate to Chem > Docking > Autodock. A dialog appears.
2. Configure the parameters:
   * `Ligands`: Specify the column within the provided dataframe that contains the small molecules to be docked.
   * `Target`: Choose the folder containing the docking configurations and the macromolecule for simulation.
   * `Conformations`: Define the number of conformations to search.
3. Run the calculations

**Performance note:** During the first run for a target Autodock calculates the 
macromolecule grids.
Grid calculation works on a single CPU core, so it can take about a minute.
Datagrok caches calculated grids, so subsequent runs with the same 
target will be much faster.

#### Analyze results

When the results are ready, you can:

1. **View docking poses**: The added column containing docking poses allows users to visualize the spatial orientation of each ligand within the binding pocket of the receptor.
2. **Check free energy**: The column with free energy numbers provides users with quantitative information about the stability of each ligand-receptor complex.
3. **Zoom to pocket**: By clicking on a pose, a Molstar viewer appears in the context panel. It automatically zooms to the binding pocket of interest, providing a closer look at the ligand-receptor interaction.
4. **Explore additional properties**: Calculated properties for the selected pose allow users to explore binding affinities, interaction energies, or other relevant information for detailed analysis.
