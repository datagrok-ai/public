# File Editors

The **File Editors** package for Datagrok allows you to open and preview various file formats directly in the Datagrok platform.

## Features

Currently, we support PDF and DOCX formats, with plans to include more in the future.

- **Text File Formats Support:** Easily open and preview PDF and DOCX files.

- **Editing Capabilities (Coming Soon):** While editing is in the works, we're aiming to introduce powerful features soon. Expect support for various text formats as we continue to enhance package.

## Usage

1. **File Preview:** When you click on a file in the File tree with a supported format, you can see a preview of the file in the **Context Panel** under the **Preview** tab.

2. **Docked Panel:** A separate docked panel is available for an extended preview experience.

3. **Opening Files:**
   - Double-click on a file to open it.
   - Right-click on a file and choose "Open" from the context menu.
   - Drag-n-drop is also supported.
