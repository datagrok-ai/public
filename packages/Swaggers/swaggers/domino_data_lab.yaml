  description: >-
    Domino has two types of APIs:


    1. The **Domino API** that you can use to operate and administer Domino
    services. These APIs are documented on this page.


    2. The **Model API** serves your code as a low-latency web service. You
    don't need any API design experience
       to turn your Python or R code into a Model API Endpoint. [Learn more about Model APIs here.](https://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001488023-Model-Manager-Overview-)

    Please note:


    * The base URL will depend on your deployment of Domino. Replace
    `https://api.dominodatalab.com` in

    the examples below with the URL of your Domino deployment. This will be the
    same as the URL you visit in your browser

    when you use the Domino application.


    * To authenticate your requests, include your API Key with the header
    `X-Domino-Api-Key`. You can find this key on your

    user account page in the Domino application.
