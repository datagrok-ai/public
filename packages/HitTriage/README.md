# Hit Triage

The **Hit Triage** package is a powerful tool designed for molecule analysis and campaign management within the Datagrok environment. It consists of two applications: [Hit Triage](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/HitTriage/README_HT.md) and [Hit Design](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/HitTriage/README_HD.md).

- The **Hit Triage** application is designed for molecule analysis and filtering. It allows users to upload a dataset, filter it, calculate molecular properties, submit the results to any chosen function or query and share campaigns between users. More about Hit Triage can be found [here](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/HitTriage/README_HT.md).

- The **Hit Design** application is similar in terms of campaign management, but instead of uploading a dataset, users can sketch molecules, calculate molecular properties, filter and organize them in stages. More about Hit Design can be found [here](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/HitTriage/README_HT.md).
