FileEditors is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform.
It provides rich 3D visualization of the molecules. The package is based on the excellent
[NGL Viewer](https://nglviewer.org/) library developed by Alexander Rose.

The following file formats are supported:
* Molecular structures (mmCIF, PDB, PQR, GRO, SDF, MOL2, MMTF)
* Density volumes (MRC/MAP/CCP4, DX/DXBIN, CUBE, BRIX/DSN6, XPLOR/CNS)

# File viewers

This package implements [custom file viewers](../../help/develop/how-to/custom-file-viewers.md)
for all supported file types. This is how it looks in action:
