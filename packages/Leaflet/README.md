Leaflet is a [package](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop#packages) for the [Datagrok](https://datagrok.ai) platform. It adds a set of interactive GIS visualizations by integrating with the awesome [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library.

The Leaflet [viewer](https://datagrok.ai/help/visualize/viewers) has two rendering options, `heat` and `markers`, and is available for tables that have columns of specific [semantic types](https://datagrok.ai/help/discover/semantic-types): `latitude` and `longitude`.
