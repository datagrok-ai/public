# Database Table

Because this table resides in an external database, the analysis is less interactive
compared to the already imported tables. There are few options for working with it:

* "Visual Query..." - lets you visually edit the query against that table, including 
aggregations, filters, pivots, and other conditions.  
* "Get All" - retrieves all data. 
Depending on the table size, it might take a lot of time and memory 
* "New SQL Query..." - starts editing a SQL query.
* "Build Query..." - opens a dialog for joining this table with the others in this schema.
Uses foreign keys information for building the UI.
