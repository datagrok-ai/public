title: "Biostructure viewer"

Biostructure viewer is used for visualizing and analyzing macromolecules.

It allows you to view 3D structures, explore docking results, and offers multiple rendering modes for different visual
representations. The viewer is based on [RCSB Molstar viewer](https://github.com/molstar/rcsb-molstar).

## Creating a biostructure viewer

1. On the menu ribbon, click the **Add viewer** icon. A dialog opens.
2. In the dialog, select  **Biostructure**.
3. Load the macromolecule file by using the "**Open...**" link in the empty viewer.

## Configuring a biostructure viewer

The biostructure viewer is configurable like other Datagrok viewers with the **Context Panel**.
To do that, click the **Gear** icon on top of the viewer.
Molstar component built-in control knobs are also available.
