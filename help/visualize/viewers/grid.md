Grid lets you efficiently work with tabular data. Think Excel on steroids, very extensible
and built to support interactive exploration of vast amounts of scientific data.

## Interacting with the grid

You can access available options for rows, columns, and cells in a number of ways:

* From an object's context menu (right-click to open)
* From the **Top Menu** options and icons
* For the current object, from the [Context Panel](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/panels.md#context-panel)
* For columns, by clicking the **Hamburger** **(≡)** icon (hover over the column's header to display)

From there, you can [change the cell format](#format-cells), [color code a column](#color-code-columns), [pin rows](#pin-rows-and-columns), and do more. For shortcuts, see [Controls](#controls).

## Rows

Grid rows have different states: 

* Selected (highlighted in orange)
* MouseOver (on hover, highlighted in light blue)
* Current (click or navigate using the up **(↑)** and down **(↓)** keys, highlighted in green). 
* Filtered

These states are synchronized with other viewers, making it easy to explore your
data. For example, moving between rows in the grid updates both the current
molecule on a scatterplot and similar molecules in the 
[similarity viewer](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#similarity-and-diversity-search).
The same works in reverse. Clicking a molecule on a scatterplot or a similarity
viewer updates the current row in all other viewers, including grid. 

To further aid with data exploration, the **Context Panel** dynamically updates
to show [info panes](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/info-panels.md) specific to
the current object, e.g., a molecule.

![](img/grid-rows-interactivity.gif)


## Columns

Unlike Excel, cells within a grid column are assigned one of the
predefined data types: `string`, `int`, `bigint`, `qnum`, `double`, `datetime`,
or `bool`. Additionally, a column may have [tags](../../govern/catalog/tags.md), a 
[semantic type](../../govern/catalog/semantic-types.md) (e.g., `Molecule`), and an 
[entity type](../../govern/catalog/sticky-meta.md#metadata-objects), which lets you
annotate specific data points with custom metadata.

To edit column settings, either right-click the column's header to access
its context menu or click the column's header to display available options
in the **Context Panel**.

Subject to permissions, you can:

* Change the column's properties (e.g., it's data type or [cell renderer](#cell-renderers))
* Customize the column's appearance or behavior (e.g., change the cell's format, color-code values, pin rows, etc.) 
* Specify who can edit a column. Users without edit permissions will receive a notification when attempting to edit a restricted column.

:::tip tips

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="navigation" label="Navigation">

For quick navigation, preview, or batch actions, use the 
[Column Manager](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/column-manager.md).
To open, on the **Status Bar**, click **Columns:**

<br/>

![](../../deploy/releases/img/column-preview-filter-by-type.gif)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="repositioning" label="Repositioning">

To quickly move a column to the beginning or end of your dataset, click the column's header and start dragging. The arrows appear. Drop the column onto an arrow to adjust its position in the spreadsheet.

<br/>

![](img/grid-column-reordering.gif)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="profiling" label="Profiling">

For quick profiling, use the **Plots** info pane. Simply select columns, and
their content is automatically visualized in the **Context Panel**.

<br/>

</Tabs>

:::

### Selecting columns

There are multiple ways to select a column:
* Shift+click on a header to select
* Ctrl+shift+click on a header to deselect
* Ctrl+click on a header to invert selected state
* Shift+drag on a header to select multiple columns at once
* From the "Columns" pane, Shift+drag on the row headers
* Press Shift+LEFT or Shift+RIGHT

Once columns get selected, they appear in the context panel. Expand different panes
to see column details, invoke commands, color-code, change style, explore statistics,
and visualize the content.

You can also [resize selected columns](#resizing-columns) by mouse-dragging column border in the header.

:::tip

Select multiple colors and apply colors and styles at once for quick formatting. Assign groups for quick filtering, selection, and navigation 

![img](img/grid-grouped-columns.gif)

:::

### Hiding and unhiding columns

There are many ways to hide a column:
* [Resize](#resizing-columns) it, bringing its width to 0
* Right-click, select "Order or hide columns...", and uncheck corresponding checkboxes
* Select a number of columns and click "Hide" on the context panel

You can tell whether there are hidden columns by looking at the column header separators -
it gets bolder and darker if there are hidden columns. To unhide a column, double-click
on the corresponding column separator, like shown on the picture below:

![](img/grid-unhide-columns.gif)

### Resizing columns

There are multiple ways to resize a column:
* Mouse-drag column border in the header
* Right-click on the grid, and choose one of the options under "Column sizing" 

![](img/grid-resize-multiple-columns.gif)

### Resizing rows and columns

When you resize row heights, columns widths automatically adjust in order to provide
the best experience. This lets you "zoom out" to see the bigger picture, or the opposite -
zoom in to see additional details in the cell (especially useful for dynamic cells that
render differently depending on your zoom level, such as proteins, users, forms, or 
JIRA tickets).

![](img/grid-dynamic-column-widths.gif)

You can do mouse-panning (with the right mouse button) just like in a Google map! It is 
particularly useful if you are exploring a big and wide dataset in the zoomed-out mode.

![](img/grid-mouse-pan-content.gif)

### Column groups

Group columns together by selecting them and then choosing the "Group columns..." action 
in the context panel. You can also specify group color. Once columns are grouped, group name will appear above 
columns names. You can use it for selecting and moving all columns at once.

You can quickly show or hide groups of columns from [filters](filters.md).

![](img/grid-column-groups.gif)

## Cells

You can customize the display of cell data using [cell renderers](#cell-renderers). Grid cells can also contain values from [multiple columns](#summary-columns) or [linked tables](#data-from-linked-tables), and display embedded [images](#images).

![](img/cell-renderers-examples.gif)

### Cell renderers

Cell renderers customize how cell data is shown. For instance, molecules in
SMILES notation may be rendered in 2D. For specific semantic types,
such as molecules or URL images, cell renderers are applied automatically. 

To apply a cell renderer manually:

1. Right click the column header and select **Column properties...**. A dialog
   opens.
1. In the dialog, set the tag key to `cell.renderer` and the tag value to the
   desired cell renderer  name (e.g., `Tags`). 
  >Note: Some cell renderers <!--(e.g., [MultiChoice])  //TODO: New doc: supported-cell-renderers.md--> may require
  >additional parameters. 
1. Click **OK**.

![](../../deploy/releases/img/release1.18-cellrend-tags-multichoice-dropdown.gif)

Examples of built-in renderers include molecules, URL based images, fit lines, comboboxes, and more. <!--For the full list, see [Supported cell renderers].  //TODO: New doc: supported-cell-renderers.md-->

:::note developers

[Create custom cell renderers](../../develop/how-to/grid/custom-cell-renderers.md)

:::

### Summary columns

Summary columns show data from multiple columns within a row. To simply display
data from multiple columns, use _smart forms_. To visualize
numerical data, use _sparklines_. To design a custom form, use _forms_.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="smart-forms" label="Smart forms" default>

Smart forms show values from multiple columns within a single cell. They inherit
color-coding and [cell renderers](#cell-renderers) from the source columns, and their content
dynamically adjusts to fit the cell size.

To add a smart form, right-click a cell and select **Add** > **Summary Columns** > **Smart Form**. To change selected columns for the summary column, click its header and choose the columns you want in the **Context Panel** under **Renderer**.

<br/>

![smart forms](../../deploy/releases/img/smart-forms.gif)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sparklines" label="Sparklines">

Sparklines use charts to visualize numerical values within a row,
offering a quick way to compare rows visually.
Supported summary column types:

* Sparklines
* Bar Chart
* Radar
* Pie Barchart
<!--* Markup-->

To add sparklines, right-click a cell and select **Add** > **Summary Columns**, then choose your preferred option from the menu. To change selected columns for the summary column, click its header and choose the columns you want in the **Context Panel** under **Renderer**.

<br/>

![Summary columns](../../uploads/viewers/grid-summary-columns.png "Summary columns")

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="forms" label="Forms">

To show data from multiple columns, you can design a form:

1. Right-click a cell, select **Add** > **Forms** > **Design a Form...**. This
   opens a [form viewer](forms.md).  
1. In the form viewer, column names and values are shown as individual components
   that you can edit. Design your form with clicks and drags.
1. Once done, click the **CLOSE AND APPLY** button to add the form as a column to your dataset.

<br/>

![Forms](img/grid-forms.gif "Forms")

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Data from linked tables

You can display data from one linked table within another. For example, you may
want to show order details alongside customer orders.

Here's how:

1. [Link the tables](../../transform/link-tables.md).
1. Right click any cell, select **Add** > **Linked Tables**, and choose the table you want. A column with data from the linked table is added to your dataset. 

![Linked table data in cell](../../deploy/releases/img/grid-nested-linked-tables.gif) 

### Images

Datagrok supports two types of images in cells: embedded and linked. Supported formats are .jpg, .png, and .jpeg.

To embed an image, double click a cell and select the source file.

![](../../develop/how-to/grid/binary-cell-renderer.gif)

For linked images, Datagrok automatically detects and visualizes images from URLs (starting with "http://" or "https://"
and ending with a supported image extension) as well as images stored as Datagrok paths (beginning with "System:" and
ending with a supported image extension) using a [cell renderer](#cell-renderers).

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

If images are not detected automatically, right-click the column header and select **Column Properties**. This opens a dialog. In the dialog, under **Tags**, set the following parameters:

* `quality` to `ImageUrl`
* `cell.renderer` to `ImageUrl`.

</details>


### Designed forms in cells

You can design a [custom form](form.md) that would represent a row in the table, and 
use this form within a cell. 

To design a form and add it to the grid:
1. Right-click on the grid
2. Select **Add | Summary Columns | Design a Form...**
3. Design a form, then click **CLOSE AND APPLY** on top. 

![](img/grid-custom-form-in-cell.gif)

:::tip tips

You can also design a [stand-alone form](form.md), or use forms as [tiles](tile-viewer.md).

:::

### HTML forms in cells

You can create forms in cells based on the arbitrary HTML, with the row values injected
using [markup](../../develop/under-the-hood/markup.md). This allows for potentially complex
visualizations, including SVG:

![](img/grid-custom-html-form.gif)

:::note fun fact

The EEG recording in the video above was recorded from Andrew Skalkin's head while he was helping build 
[JAKE](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30872988/#&gid=article-figures&pid=figure-3-uid-2) 
sometime around 2016, back at Johnson & Johnson. Fun times! :)

Datagrok is one of the very few web application capable of interactively working with sensor data - you can open
datasets with up to a billion data points OR a million columns (not at the same time, of course).

:::

### Adaptive number formatting

Initially, the format of the numerical and datetime values is chosen in a way that lets you
differentiate between values in a column. For instance, if all datetime values in a column have the
time component set to "0:0", only the date is shown. When you import a CSV file, the number of
significant digits is just enough to represent all digits after comma.  

If you [resize a column](#resizing-columns) so that the content doesn't fit anymore, at first
the precision will be degraded - time will be stripped out of dates, floating point numbers will
lose precision and eventually will be rendered as integers. If you make the width even smaller,
eventually the value will be rendered as a circle with the color indicating the cell value.
For numbers, darker colors correspond to higher values. For strings, each value gets assigned 
its own color.

![Adaptive number formatting](img/grid-adaptive-number-formatting.gif)


## Working with data

Subject to permissions, you can [add, delete, or modify records in your dataset](#controls). 
In addition, the **Top Menu** provides multiple options for data
cleaning and transformation. For example, you can
 [add calculated columns](../../transform/add-new-column.md),
[impute missing values](../../explore/missing-values-imputation.md), 
[delete duplicates](../../transform/aggregate-rows.md), and more.

To learn more about data transformation, visit the 
[Transform](../../transform/transform.md) section of our documentation.

In addition to actions directly on your table's data, you can augment your
dataset with additional information. You have these options:

* Use built in tools from the **Top Menu**. For example, for molecules, you can add
  a column with descriptors via **Top Menu** > **Chem** > **Calculate** >
  **Descriptors...**
* Add columns using info panes

  <details>
  <summary>How to add</summary>

  You can add the content of most info panes as a column. 

  To add the entire info pane, click the **Add new column** **(...)** icon next to
  the info pane's name. To add a specific calculation or object within an info
  pane, click the **plus (+)** icon next to the object or calculation you want to
  add. 

  ![](img/grid-add-data-info-panes.gif)

  </details>

### Filtering

To toggle filters, in the **Top Menu**, click the filter icon.

![](img/grid-filtering.gif)

Text filters highlight the occurrences of the search term right in the grid:  

![](img/grid-search-highlights.gif)

The **Filters Panel** is a [viewer](viewers.md). [Learn more about filters](filters.md).

### Searching

Press Ctrl+F to open a search box. You can search for substrings, or enter expressions
in the form of `[column] [operator] [value]`, such as "age > 30". Matching values
get highlighted as you type. Press UP or DOWN to go to the previous or next match.

Click the hamburger menu on the right of the input field to access these options:
* **Select matching**: Select all matching rows
* **Filter matching**: Filter all matching rows
* **Auto-select**: Select all matching rows as you type
* **Auto-filter**: Filter all matching rows as you type

:::

### Add rows and columns

To add a new row, either click the **plus (+)** icon after the bottom row in your dataset. Alternatively, go to the **Top Menu** and select **Edit** > **Add rows..**. This opens a dialog where you can specify the number of rows to add, as well as their position relative to your current row.

To add a new column:

1. In the **Top Menu**, click the **Add New Column...** icon. This opens a dialog.
1. In the dialog, specify the column's name and data type and click **OK**. 
1. An empty column is added to the dataset.
1. Optional. To specify a column's [semantic type](../../govern/catalog/semantic-types.md), [tags](../../govern/catalog/tags.md), or [cell renderer](#cell-renderers), use the [column's properties](#columns).

![](img/grid-add-new-rows-columns.gif)

[Learn how to add calculated columns](../../transform/add-new-column.md).

### Pin rows and columns

You can pin rows and columns from the context menu. Pinned rows can be saved in
projects and as layouts, using the column's name and cell
value (for unique rows only).

To pin:

1. Select rows or columns you want to pin. 
1. Right-click your selection and choose the relevant option from the **Pin**
   menu. Your selection is now pinned.

To unpin rows, select the **Unpin** option from the **Pin** context menu.

![Pinned rows](img/pinned-rows.gif "Pinned rows")

### Color code columns  

You can color code columns with these schemes: 
   
* For categorical columns (`string` and `bool` data types), "categorical"
* For numeric columns, "conditional" or "linear"
* For `datetime` columns, "linear"

To color-code a column, right click its header and select the desired scheme
from the **Color Coding** submenu. This applies color to the
column's background. To customize color-coding settings, click the column's
header and adjust them in the **Context Panel** under **Colors**.

![](img/grid-color-coding.gif)

To copy color coding from one column to others, use the **Pick Up Coloring** and
**Apply Coloring** commands from the column's **Color Coding** menu. These
commands copy both standard and custom color-coding, including the **Off** setting
which removes color coding. Note that you can't transfer settings
between numeric and categorical columns. The **Apply Coloring** command remains
inactive if no color coding has been picked up. These settings are retained for
a viewer instance but are not saved through layout serialization. <!-- //TODO rewrite the last sentence for clarity-->

### Show, hide, or reorder columns

To show, hide, or reorder columns:

1. Right-click any cell and select **Order or Hide Columns...**. A dialog opens
2. In the dialog:
   * To hide a column, clear a checkbox next to the column's name. To show a
     column, select the corresponding checkbox. 
   * To reorder columns, drag column names or use the arrow controls

<br/>

![](img/grid-column-hide-reorder.gif)

### Inspect multiple columns

**Columns** pane allows you to easily search, select, and navigate columns 
in the table. To toggle pane visibility, click **Columns** on the status bar in the bottom,
or press Alt+C.
