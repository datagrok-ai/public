title: "3D Scatter plot"
---

Use 3D scatter plot to plot data points on three axes to show the relationship between three variables. Each row in the
data table is represented by a marker whose position depends on its values in the columns set on the X, Y, and Z axes.
Additionally, you can color-code and size-code points, as well as display labels next to markers.
