title: "Supported viewers"
---

A _viewer_ is a visual component associated with a
[table](../../datagrok/concepts/table.md). They are [extremely fast and interactive](../../develop/under-the-hood/performance.md#viewers), handling
datasets with tens of millions of rows (or millions of columns).

To learn how to use viewers, including creation, managing properties,
filtering, row selection, tooltips, and more, see [Table View](../../datagrok/navigation/views/table-view.md#viewer-properties).
