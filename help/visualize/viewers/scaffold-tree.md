# Scaffold Tree

Scaffold tree allows to organize large molecular data sets by arranging sets of
molecules into a unique tree hierarchy based on their scaffolds, with scaffolds
forming leaf nodes of such tree. The hierarchy is created by iterative removal
of rings from more complex scaffolds using chemically meaningful set of rules,
until a single, root ring is obtained.
