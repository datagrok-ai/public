# Scatter Plot

A scatter plot (also called a scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram) is a
type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two
variables for a set of data. If the points are color-coded you can increase the number of displayed
variables to three. The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one
variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable
determining the position on the vertical axis.
