# Form

Form allows you to customize the appearance of the row by manually positioning the fields, and adding
other visual elements, such as pictures or panels. A form can be used either as a stand-alone viewer,
or as a row template of the [Tile Viewer](tile-viewer.md). 

## Editable forms
To edit values via the form, click on the 'edit' icon on top. 

## Built-in form designer
To reposition the fields, click on the 'presentation' icon, and then drag-and-drop fields 
to the new locations. To change visual properties of an element, click on it while in the 
designer mode; properties will appear in the [property panel](../../overview/property-panel.md) 
on the right.

Field color-coding and format are picked up from the corresponding grid, if possible.

The following keyboard shortcuts work only when the form is in both read-only
and presentation modes: 

|                           |                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| <, left or up             | Previous row           |
| >, right or down          | Next row               |
| Space                     | Toggle selected state  |
