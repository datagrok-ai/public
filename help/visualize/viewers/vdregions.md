# VdRegions

VdRegions is used to visualize a graphical representation of multiple sequence alignment for several chains 
in peptide structure per functionally important regions for example Complementary Determined Region (CDR) or 
Framework regions (FR) of antibodies.

TODO: There should be a picture here, but we need to find data without restrictions.
