## Specify environment

Set an `environment` parameter of the script
to a one-liner YAML following the standard Conda YAML config (omit it's name).

For example, we need to use the following Conda config:

```yaml
name: envtest01
channels:
  - Conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - glom
  - pip:
      - requests
```

To use it in a script, specify it as follows:

```python
#name: EnvTestInline
#environment: channels: [Conda-forge], dependencies: [python=3.8, glom, {pip: [requests]}]
#language: python
#output: string result

import re, requests
from glom import glom
import pandas as pd

target = {'a': {'b': {'c': 'd'}}}
result = glom(target, 'a.b.c')  # returns 'd'
```

:::tip First launch may take time

When the script runs the first time, Datagrok creates the environment on
the Compute Virtual Machine,
which may take up to several minutes.
For all next script runs, Datagrok will reuse this environment.

:::

Datagrok distinguishes in-place environments using *MD5 hashes* of their body strings.
If there is a ready-to-use environment with the same environment config,
Datagrok will reuse it.


## Store the environment in a package

You may store your configurations in a package's `environment` folder. They should use Conda YAML format.
You can create an environment YAML
[manually](https://docs.Conda.io/projects/Conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually)
or
[export it](https://docs.Conda.io/projects/Conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
form your existing Conda environment.

If the `environment` tag in the script header is not specified, the script uses
[the default configuration](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/environments/default.yaml).

:::tip

Here is an
[example of configuration](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/environments)
for the Datagrok public repository.
Also, a package can define its own
configurations as well ([see examples](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Demo/scripts)).

:::

This is how to define the "Chemprop" environment in the script header:

```python
#environment: Chemprop
```

In this case, the environment `Chemprop` should be specified in a file
`environments/Chemprop.yaml` inside the package where this script belongs.

Datagrok distinguishes package environments by their *names*.
Datagrok will reuse a previously created environment for all subsequent runs
with no delay.
