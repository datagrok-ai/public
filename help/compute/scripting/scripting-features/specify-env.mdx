title: "Specify the environment"
---

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/browser-window';
```

Set an `environment` parameter of the script
to a one-liner YAML following the standard Conda YAML config (omit it's name).

For example, we need to use the following Conda config:

```yaml
name: envtest01
channels:
  - Conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - glom
  - pip:
      - requests
```

To use it in a script, specify it as follows:

```python
#name: EnvTestInline
#environment: channels: [Conda-forge], dependencies: [python=3.8, glom, {pip: [requests]}]
#language: python
#output: string result

import re, requests
from glom import glom
import pandas as pd

target = {'a': {'b': {'c': 'd'}}}
result = glom(target, 'a.b.c')  # returns 'd'
```

:::tip First launch may take time

When the script runs the first time, Datagrok creates the environment on
the Compute Virtual Machine,
which may take up to several minutes.
For all next script runs, Datagrok will reuse this environment.

:::

Datagrok distinguishes in-place environments using *MD5 hashes* of their body strings.
If there is a ready-to-use environment with the same environment config, Datagrok will reuse it.
