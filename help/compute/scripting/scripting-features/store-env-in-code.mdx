title: "Store the environment in a package"

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/browser-window';
```

You may store your configurations in a package's `environment` folder. They should use Conda YAML format.
You can create an environment YAML
[manually](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually)
or
[export it](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
form your existing Conda environment.

If the `environment` tag in the script header is not specified, the script uses
[the default configuration](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/environments/default.yaml).

:::tip

Here is an
[example of configuration](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/environments)
for the Datagrok public repository.
Also, a package can define its own
configurations as well ([see examples](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Samples/scripts)).

:::

This is how to define the "Chemprop" environment in the script header:

```python
#environment: Chemprop
```

In this case, the environment `Chemprop` should be specified in a file
`environments/Chemprop.yaml` inside the package where this script belongs.

Datagrok distinguishes package environments by their *names*.
Datagrok will reuse a previously created environment for all subsequent runs
with no delay.
