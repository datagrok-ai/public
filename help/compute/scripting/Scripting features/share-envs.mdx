```

### Python (using Conda)

You may share environments by referencing them in your scripts.
Conda environment will be re-used by many users, which is more space- and time-efficient.

To achieve it, do the following steps:

1. Create one package to contain global environments (say, `GlobalEnvs`).
2. Create an environment to share inside of this package (let it be `GlobalEnvDataAnalysis`).
3. Publish `GlobalEnvs` package with `--release` option to the platform.
4. Share it with the specific group of users you want to have access to these environments.
5. Environment will be available as `GlobalEnvs:GlobalEnvDataAnalysis`

#### Conda and Pip custom repositories

By default, Conda uses [Conda-forge](https://Conda-forge.org/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) repositories to install packages.
You may specify your own package repositories in the environment specification.

For example, to use `http://my-repo/custom/` as Conda repository
and `https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/pypi/simple` as PIP repository use the following code:

```python
#environment: channels: [http://my-repo/custom/], dependencies: [python=3.8, glom, {pip: [--index-url https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/pypi/simple, requests]}]
```

#### Common issues with Conda environments

There is a [known](https://github.com/Conda/Conda/issues/8051#issuecomment-464199791)
[issue](https://github.com/Conda/Conda/issues/8051#issuecomment-631862928)
[of Conda](https://github.com/Conda/Conda/issues/8051#issuecomment-808789923)
that sometimes it takes a long time to resolve dependencies.
Datagrok will interrupt Conda environment creation if it takes more than 5 minutes.

If you encounter a timing problem, try to find an equivalent set of packages from PIP repositories.

### R (using Renv)

Datagrok supports [Renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) environments. Each R
script has a temporary folder with a unique name. This folder becomes an
Renv project folder for the current run of the script.

Start using Renv by initializing it and installing packages (see a
[full example](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Demo/scripts/r/renv_spelling.R)):

```R
#language: r

renv::init()
renv::install("hunspell@3.0.1")
```

Renv session only impacts the R environment for this one single run.
No other R scripts are aware of this local script environment.

Renv uses a global package cache.
It caches a package requested once with `renv::install` and re-uses it whenever it is
requested.

In case the latest package version is requested,
such as in `renv::install("hunspell")`,
Renv connects to remote R package repositories
assuring if the cached package needs to be updated to the newer version.
This may introduce a significant delay in the script run, several seconds in practice.
To avoid this, we recommend
installing a specific version of the package, such as in `renv::install("hunspell@3.0.1")`.

:::note Automatic deactivation

At the R script's start and finish,
Datagrok calls `renv::deactivate()` to assure the script's body isolation.
You don't have to call `renv::deactivate()` manually.
