## What is Datagrok scripting?

Scripting is a powerful feature that enhances your data analysis experience with Datagrok.
It combines Datagrok's full range of capabilities
with thousands of statistical packages and visualizations available in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Python](https://www.python.org),
[Octave](https://octave.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org), or
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com).

 you can create custom data analysis scripts, display results in
[viewers](../../visualize/viewers/viewers.md),
leverage [Datagrok enterprise capabilities]( ../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md),
and more.

Key differences between scripting and "full" Datagrok programming:

* Scripts can be written in any supported language,
  including Python, R, Octave, JavaScript, and SQL (for data queries).
* To integrate scripts with Datagrok, you only need
  [Datagrok functional annotations]( ../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md),
  without requiring knowledge of the Datagrok JavaScript API.
