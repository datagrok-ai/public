## What is Datagrok scripting?

Scripting is a powerful feature that enhances your data analysis experience with Datagrok.
It combines Datagrok's full range of capabilities
with thousands of statistical packages and visualizations available in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Python](https://www.python.org),
[Octave](https://octave.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org), or
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com). You can create custom data analysis scripts, display results in
[viewers](../../visualize/viewers/viewers.md),
leverage [Datagrok enterprise capabilities]( ../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md),
and more.

Unlike "heavy" Datagrok components, scripts can be written in any supported language,
including Python, R, Octave, JavaScript, and SQL (for data queries). To integrate scripts with Datagrok, you only need
[Datagrok functional annotations]( ../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md),
without requiring knowledge of the Datagrok JavaScript API.

* To learn the basics of scripting, start with the [Getting started with scripting](getting-started.md) section.
* The [Scripting features](scripting-features/scripting-features.md) section demonstrates
how to improve the UI for your scripts and visualize results in Datagrok viewers.
* For information on creating advanced user interfaces and maximizing scripting capabilities,
visit the [Advanced scripting](advanced-scripting/advanced-scripting.mdx) section.
