You can convert a script to a package function to:
- Save the script in the version control system (e.g., Git).
- Call your script from other scripts or fucntions by a stable name.

Follow these steps to achieve it:

1. Create a TypeScript [package](../../../develop/develop.md#packages).

  ```shell
  grok create package_name --ts
  ```

2. Add your script to the package.

    a. For Python, R, Julia, and other server-side languages, create
    the `scripts` folder in your package directory and place your
    script file in it.

    b. If you are writing in Javascript/Typescript, you can convert
    your script to a package function, annotate it, and add directly
    to `src` package.ts file:

    ```typescript
    //name: DemoScript
    //tags: demo
    //input: int input1
    //output: int result
    export async function DemoScript(input1: number) {
      return 1;
    }
    ```

3. Compile and [publish](../../../develop/develop.md#publishing) the package:

    ```shell
    npm run build && grok publish your_environment
    ```

    To make your package publicly available, use the `--release` [publishing mode](../../../develop/develop.md#publishing-modes).

    ```shell
    npm run build && grok publish your_environment --release
    ```

Now you can call your function using:

    ```typescript
    const result = await grok.functions.call('package_name:DemoScript', { input1: 10 }); // result = 1
    ```

For a JS function with a single output, the output will be returned
directly. If there are multiple outputs, a function will return an
Object with key value results.

:::note

To return multiple outputs from a function inside package.ts, just
return an Object with key value results.
