### Turning code into a Datagrok script

Briefly, you only need to do the following:

* Create a new script file in the
  [Datagrok script editor](getting-started.md)
* Write the code in any supported language.
* Add **header**: the set of annotation comments specifying the script language, tags,
  input and output variables.

That's all.

### Runtime environment

For each language, Datagrok uses a predefined header and creates an environment with the set of pre-installed packages.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
```

```python
import os
import io
import json
import pandas as pd
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="r" label="R">
```

```r
require(httr)
require(repr)
require(data.table)
require(R.utils)
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="octave" label="Octave">
```

Octave scripts run in a separate container on server. This container has following Octave packages pre-installed:

* [symbolic](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/symbolic/)
* [optim](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/optim/)

Always provide `pkg load %PACKAGE_NAME%` in your scripts, since script runs are fully independent.

```julia

using DataFrames

```

<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript">
```

```javascript
import * as grok from 'datagrok-api/grok';
import * as ui from 'datagrok-api/ui';
import * as DG from 'datagrok-api/dg';
import * as OCL from 'openchemlib/full.js';
import * as rxjs from 'rxjs';
import * as rxjs.operators from 'rxjs/operators';
import * as $ from 'cash-dom';
import * as dayjs from 'dayjs';
import * as wu from 'wu';
import * as exceljs from 'ExcelJS';
import * as html2canvas from 'html2canvas';
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
```

### Environment isolation

You can specify an environment for the script to use,
including the language version and a set of libraries.

Datagrok uses [Conda](https://docs.Conda.io/en/latest/)
as the environment management system.
A Conda environment:

- isolates each script run,
- resolves dependencies,
- and takes time to be created before a script run.

Later, the script uses the pre-created environment with *no delay* for resolving dependencies.

In Datagrok, Conda environment configuration can be specified either [right inside the script](scripting-features/specify-env.mdx),
or as part of a package.
