It is possible to start a workflow from code and even obtain workflow
results provided a top level has `onReturn` hook. There will be a
special ui accpect button to run the hook and exit, otherwise
undefined will be returned on a regular close.



```
const startFunc = DG.Func.find({package: 'Compute2', name: 'StartWorkflow'})[0];
const funcCall = startFunc.prepare({nqName: 'SomePackage:SomeWorkflow, version: '1.0'})

await funcCall.call();
const result = funcCall.getOutputParamValue();
```


For dynamic workflow it is also possible to configure which dynamic
steps will be initially used in the workflow via `instanceConfig` option.
```
const funcCall = startFunc.prepare({nqName: 'SomePackage:SomeWorkflow, version: '1.0', instanceConfig: {id: 'some_wworkflow', steps: [{id: 'load', initialValues: {deviceClass: 'Bioreactor Class'}, inputRestrictions: {deviceClass: 'disabled'}}]}})
```
