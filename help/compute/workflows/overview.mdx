This section provides a brief overview of primary workflow
terms and concepts.

## Main terms

Before starting to work with workflows, we need to define several terms:
* **Node** - any Datagrok script.
  * Node input: data that the step consumes
  * Node output: data that the step produces
* **Link** - connects steps.
  Links can pass data directly from the input of one step
  to the output of another step or apply some transformations.
  * Link source: where to take data from
  * Link target: where to put data
  * Link handler: a TypeScript function performing data transformation.
    Using handlers, the user can apply small non-interactive transformation to data between steps.
* **Configuration**: a tree of JavaScript objects holding workflow definition: nodes and links
* **Workflow provider**: A javaScript function, that returns Workflow configuration object
  TBD: Cover in the description:
* **Controller**:
* **Action**:
* **FuncCall**:

### Scripts nodes

As described in the [scripting](../scripting) section, scripts are just
functions with a set of inputs and outputs (usually abbreviated to IO
in workflow documentation).
Changes of inputs and outputs are tracked
in real time and are used to trigger links.
Also, a user can save the current workflow state and load it later.

### Links

**Links** are connections that are either pass data directly from a source
script IO to target or do some transformations via a TypeScript function
called link handler.
There are multiple types of links;
some of them use source scripts inputs/outputs to pass data to a virtual target,
which is not stored in a script io.
This way it is possible to have a derived state, for example a validation state.

Link handlers make data transformations.
A Link Handler is a TypeScript function
that receives a `controller` object argument.
Each link type has its own controller type with slightly different methods
to get and set inputs/outputs.

Link Handlers is a good way to apply some fast none-interactive
transformation to the data, when making a separate script step is and overkill.

Note that inputs/outputs of links are different from inputs/outputs of scripts.
A script output is usually connected to a link input,
and a link output connects to the next script input.
More details about different link types are available [here](link-types).

### Configuration

**Configuration** is a special TypeScript object
used to describe a workflow.
You can access TypeScript configuration typing by installing
`@datagrok-libraries/compute-api` package.

`PipelineConfiguration` type describes an n-ary tree
structure where leafs are scripts.
Each nested level might have links
definitions which target own or nested scripts IO.
The main restriction for links is to have information propagated only forward
(depth-first graph ordering).
More information about configuration is
available [here](configuration).
The configuration is used to make a UI navigation tree.
