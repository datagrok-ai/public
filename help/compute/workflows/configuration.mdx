In this section the configuration object will
be described in depth, including an intial workflow package setup.

### Setup

There is a example of a minimal setup
[here](examples#development-setup-and-test). To register a pipeline a package
function with at least these annotations is needed:
```
//tags: model
//editor: Compute2:TreeWizardEditor
//input: object params
//output: object result
```

Tag `model` means that it will be added to ModelHub (__TODO__ Docs and
link), and `editor` specifies that when launching via ModelHub a
workflow will be started. Output of the function should be of type
`PipelineConfiguration`, and input will be an object with `version`
field, so it is possible to have multiple workflow versions at the
same time.

__TODO__ multi-versioning

### General conventions

Configuration is a n-ary tree of JavaScript objects and arrays of type
`PipelineConfiguration`.

- Most objects will have a mandatory `id` field, for definitions
  object `id` should be unique inside an array, for reference arrays
  `id` might be repeated.
- If a field could have configuration objects of different types,
  field `type` is used to specify the type. Typescript will figure out
  type of the object and its fields by `type` field.

### Pipelines

Pipeline is an object of `PipelineConfiguration`, which is used to
define a set of steps. Each step is either another
[pipeline](#pipelines), a [pipeline reference](#reusing-pipelines) or a
[script node](#script-nodes).

There are three pipeline types, specified by the `type` field:

- `static`
- `parallel`
- `sequential`

[Static pipeline](#static-pipelines) is an immutable sequence of steps. It is using
field `steps` to define its steps.

Parallel and sequential are [dynamic
pipelines](#dynamic-pipelines). The difference between them is mostly
conventional, sequential pipeline is the name suggest a mutable
sequence of steps, and parallel pipeline steps should not depend on
each other. Both are using `stepTypes` field to define steps.
