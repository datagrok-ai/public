In this section the configuration object is described in depth.

### Workflow providers

There is an example of a minimal workflow package setup
[here](examples).
To register a workflow, a package
function (called a provider), with at least these annotations is needed:
```
//tags: model
//editor: Compute2:TreeWizardEditor
//input: object params
//output: object result
```

`editor` tag is a system tag used by the platform to launch a workflow.
Tag `model` means that it will be added to ModelHub.
The function must return an object of type `PipelineConfiguration`, and accept
an input object containing a `version` field.
This structure allows multiple
[workflow versions](#workflow-versioning) to coexist simultaneously.

`PipelineConfiguration` is a workflow configuration, which is used to
define a set of steps and workflow options. Where step is either
another [workflow](#workflow-providers), a [workflow
reference](#reusing-workflows) or a [script
node](#script-nodes). Depending on a workflow [type](#type), steps are
configured slightly differently.

### General conventions

Configuration is a tree of JavaScript objects and arrays of type
`PipelineConfiguration`.

- Most objects will have a mandatory `id` field, for definitions
  object `id` should be unique inside an array, for reference arrays
  `id` might be repeated.
- If a field could have configuration objects of different types,
  field `type` is used to specify the type. TypeScript will figure out
  the type of the object and its fields by `type` field.
- If an item has a corresponding UI element, usually a field
  `friendlyName` could be used to customize it.

### Common configuration options

The following fields are available for `PipelineConfiguration` of
types `static`, `parallel` and `sequential`.

#### `id`

This id is used in [links](./links-spec) for paths.

#### `type`

There are three workflow types and a reference type, specified by the
`type` field:

- `static`
- `parallel`
- `sequential`
- `ref`

[Static workflow](#static-workflows) is an immutable sequence of
steps. It is using field [steps](#steps) to define its steps.

Parallel and sequential are [dynamic
workflows](#dynamic-workflows). The difference between them is mostly
conventional, sequential workflow, as the name suggest, is a mutable
sequence of steps. Parallel workflow is a mutable set of steps, where
steps should not depend on each other. Both are using
the [stepTypes](#steptypes) field to define steps.

References are used to [reuse](#reusing-workflows) configurations
returned by providers. References have a different set of fields;
however, they are effectively replaced by a workflow configuration.

#### `nqName`

This is a full name of the corresponding [provider](#workflow-providers),
containing package name and the script name, separated by `:`.
This field is only applicable for workflow references and is not used for
nested workflows that are not [references](#reusing-workflows).

#### `version`

This is just a string, should match a [provider](#workflow-providers)
input. Not used for nested workflows that are not
[references](#reusing-workflows).

#### `friendlyName`

_Optional_.

A user-friendly name of a workflow, will be shown in UI.

#### `links`

_Optional_

Links specification, described [here](./link-types).

#### `actions`

_Optional_

Actions specification, described [here](./link-types).

#### `onInit`

_Optional_

Init hook specification, described [here](./link-types#init-hook).

#### `states`

_Optional_

A list states, each state is just an object with `id`. Could be used
to store data from [onInit](./link-types#init-hook) hook, or some
derived state based on scripts inputs/outputs. These states could be
used in links the same way as scripts inputs/outputs.

#### `tags`

_Optional_

A list of strings. The primary use case if for annotating that a
step/workflow has a certain structural invariant, like the interface
concept in programming. Could be matched in
[links](./links-spec.mdx#tag-selectors).

#### `structureCheck`

_Optional_

A synchronous function that could do checks on dynamic workflow items
themselves (not just inputs/outputs). Receives `PipelineOutline`
input, should return `ValidationResult` or undefined. Could be used to
check an order of steps and give a user errors/warnings if the current
dynamic workflow steps state has issues. `ValidationResult` is the
same as described [here](./link-types#setvalidation).

#### `customExports`

_Optional_

An array of items, with `id`, `friendlyName` and `handler`, used to
defined custom exports for workflow data. Handler here is an async
function that receives `PipelineState` and `ExportUtils` arguments.

### Static workflows

#### `steps`

Is an array of nested `PipelineConfiguration` items or [script
node](#script-nodes) . Each item must have an unique
id. This array defines an immutable sequence of steps, but if nested
workflows are dynamic, those could be internally mutated.

### Dynamic workflows

#### `stepTypes`

Is an array of nested `PipelineConfiguration` items or [script
node](#script-nodes) . Each item must have an unique id. There are
additional [options](#additional-steptypes-items-options) per each
item. Users might add/remove/reorder items from this list during the
workflow.

#### `initialSteps`

_Optional_

Is an array of initial steps. Each item is a reference to a
[stepTypes](#steptypes) item.

### Additional stepTypes items options

For [dynamic workflows](#dynamic-workflows), the `stepTypes` array has additional
options available that limit a user's ability to alter the
workflow.
If more validation logic is needed, a
[structureCheck](#structurecheck) can be used.

#### `disableUIAdding`

_Optional_

This dynamic item type cannot be added from the UI.

#### `disableUIRemoving`

_Optional_

This dynamic item type cannot be removed from the UI.

#### `disableUIDragging`

_Optional_

This dynamic item type cannot be dragged from the UI.


### Script nodes

These are end nodes in the configuration graph aka leafs. These nodes
provide additional configuration for scripts.

#### `id`

This id is used in [links](./links-spec) for paths.

#### `nqName`

Mandatory script full name.

#### `type`

_Optional_

Could be omitted, but the only other possible value is `step`.

#### `friendlyName`

_Optional_

A user-friendly name of a script to show in UI.

#### `actions`

_Optional_

Same as workflow [actions](#actions)

#### `tags`

_Optional_

Same as workflow [tags](#tags)

#### `initialValues`

_Optional_

A key-value object of input initial values. Will override scripts own
initial values. __Note__ Initial values don't trigger links, so there
should be no data links that are dependent only on inputs with initial
values.

#### `inputRestrictions`

_Optional_

A key-value object with input initial restrictions. Used with
[initialValues](#initialvalues). Read more about restrictions
[here](./link-types).

#### `viewersHook`

_Optional_

Is a JavaScript function that is used to tweak options of `DG.Viewer`,
potentially based on metadata state. More information about metadata
links is available [here](./link-types). Here is the TypeScript
signature of viewersHook:

```
(ioName: string, type: string, viewer?: DG.Viewer, meta?: any) => void;
```

`ioName` is the name of input/output and `type` is a type of the
viewer.


### Reusing workflows

It is done using a reference object. A returned by the provider
function object will just replace a `ref` object.

#### `id`

_Optional_

Not used, id of the returned workflow will be used.

#### `type`

`ref` must be provided to distinguish from other configuration types.

#### `provider`

`nqName` of the provider function.

#### `version`

A versions string that will be passed as an argument to the provider
function.


### Workflow versioning

There are might be multiple workflow versions available, so to allow a
user to launch different workflow versions directly, the following
[provider](#workflow-providers) function annotation could be used.

```
//meta.versions: ["2.0", "1.0"]
```

__Note__ that all versions must not be removed or altered in a
non-compatible way, regardless of the meta-annotation, otherwise
user's saved state of such workflows could not be
loaded. Non-compatible here means that is not possible to get the same
results with the same steps and inputs.

For a toplevel workflow all saved users's data across all versions is
available.

For nested [references](#reusing-workflows) items only a
specific version workflow data is available.

When creating a new workflow version, all dependent workflows that need to use
the updated dependency must also release new versions.
This ensures proper version compatibility across the workflow ecosystem.
