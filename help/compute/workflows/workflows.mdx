title: "Low-code workflows"

Every Datagrok [script](../scripting) is a function that consumes some input data
and returns output data.
However, Datagrok scripts are not interactive.

For multi-step interactive data processing, Datagrok offers the workflow capability.
A workflow is a series of steps with connected inputs and outputs.
The user can execute the workflow step-by-step,
review intermediate results and tune the behavior of subsequent steps.

## Datagrok low-code workflow capabilities

* Organize a series of steps into a workflow.
* Change inputs and review outputs for each step
* Ensure workflow consistency â€“ identify and rerun all steps which input data have changed.
* Dynamically modify workflow scheme: change step order, add/remove steps, apply the same step several times (check that we can do it)
* Put restrictions on steps order and connections
* Use nested workflows - use a workflow as a step of another workflow.

In simple terms, workflows provide an end-user alterable sequence of
steps, where some inputs are autofilled based on previous scripts
outputs.
Each individual script can be a building block of a workflow.
For each script the platform generates UI via
[RichFunctionView](../scripting/advanced-scripting/rich-function-view).
