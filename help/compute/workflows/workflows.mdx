title: "Low-code workflows"
---

There might be many [scripts](../scripting) deployed to the platform
and often users will have certain use patterns. Datagrok provides a
low-code solution to structure and organize multiple scripts into easy
to use workflows.

Each individual script can be viewed as a building block of a user
workflow. For each script the platform already has a [generated
UI]('/') (__TODO:__ RFV url). So passing an output of one script to
another script input is a simple workflow.

More precisely, workflow in this documentation section means a
uniderectional acyclic graph where vertexes are
[scripts](overview#scripts-as-nodes) inputs/outputs and edges are
[links](overview#links-as-edges) between them. Links could use simple
Typescript functions called [handlers](overview#links-handlers) to
implement arbitrary transformations. Workflow could be
[static](configuration#static-pipelines) meaning, a set of vertexes
and edges is immutable. It is possible to create [dynamic
workflows](configuration#dynamic-pipelines), where a set of vertexes
and edges could be altered during the workflow itself.
