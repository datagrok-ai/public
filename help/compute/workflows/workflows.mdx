title: "Low-code workflows"
---

Every Datagrok [script](../scripting) is a function that consumes and returns data.
However, Datagrok scripts are not interactive.

To enable interactive multi-step data processing, Datagrok provides the low-code workflow capabilities.
A workflow consists of a series of connected steps, where outputs from one step can serve as inputs for another.
Users can execute these workflows step-by-step,
examining intermediate results and adjusting parameters for subsequent steps.

## Datagrok low-code workflow capabilities

* Organize a series of steps into a workflow.
* Change inputs and review outputs for each step
* Ensure workflow consistency – identify and rerun all steps which input data have changed.
* Dynamically modify the workflow scheme: change step order, add/remove steps, apply the same step several times
* Put restrictions on step order and connections
* Make nested workflows — use a workflow as a step of another workflow.

Simply put, workflows create a flexible sequence of steps that users can modify,
with automatic input population based on outputs from previous steps.
Any individual script can serve as a building block within a workflow.
The platform automatically generates a user interface for each script using
[RichFunctionView](../scripting/advanced-scripting/rich-function-view).
