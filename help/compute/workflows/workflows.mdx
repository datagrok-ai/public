title: "Low-code workflows"
---

There might be many [scripts](../scripting) deployed to the platform
and often users will have certain use patterns. Datagrok provides a
low-code solution to structure and organize multiple scripts into easy
to use workflows.

Each individual script can be viewed as a building block of a user
workflow. For each script the platform already has a generated
UI (__TODO:__ RFV link). For example, passing an output of one
script to another script input is a simple workflow.

__TODO: Some gif, link to public and example walkthrough__

In simple terms, workflows provide an end-user alterable sequence of
steps, where some inputs are autofilled based on previous scripts
outputs.

More precisely, workflow in this documentation section means a
uniderectional acyclic graph, defined by a [configuration
object](configuration) where vertexes are
[scripts](overview#scripts-as-nodes) inputs/outputs and edges are
[links](overview#links-as-edges) between them. Links could use simple
Typescript functions called [handlers](overview#links-handlers) to
implement arbitrary transformations. Workflow could be
[static](configuration#static-pipelines), where a set of vertexes and
edges is immutable. It is also possible to create [dynamic
workflows](configuration#dynamic-pipelines), where a set of vertexes
and edges could be altered during the workflow itself. Also one
workflow can be a part of another workflow using [shared
configuration](configuration#reusing-pipelines).

More examples and step by step walkthroughs are available
[here](examples).
