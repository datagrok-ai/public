title: "Low-code workflows"
---

There might be many [scripts](../scripting) deployed to the platform
and often users will have certain use patterns. Datagrok provides a
low-code solution to structure and organize multiple scripts into easy
to use workflows.

Each individual script can be viewed as a building block of a user
workflow. For each script the platform already has a generated
[UI](../scripting/advanced-scripting/rich-function-view). For example,
passing an output of one script to another script input is a simple
workflow.

__TODO: Some gif, link to public and example walkthrough__

In simple terms, workflows provide an end-user alterable sequence of
steps, where some inputs are autofilled based on previous scripts
outputs.

More examples and step by step walkthroughs are available
[here](examples).
