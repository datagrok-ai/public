## Datasets
> Note: so far, there is only (linkable) information on public datasets: https://datagrok.ai/help/features/public-datasets
Need to expand https://datagrok.ai/help/features/toolbox
Also, need info for Contextual Help

When you select a **Dataset**, you will see the a similar screen to the following. From left to right, relevant features appear on the [Toolbox](https://datagrok.ai/help/features/toolbox), the data is represented in the [Main View](https://datagrok.ai/help/entities/view-layout), and additional info on the data shows up on the [Property Panel](https://datagrok.ai/help/features/property-panel) and the Contextual Help Panel.

### Workspace, Panels and Views

The Datagrok platform is fully browser-oriented and suitable for desktop devices. You can import your data into the workspace. Depending on the data, you will see suitable features available to use in your workspace. The fatures are organized in panels to be accesible, namely from left to right the main elements are: **toolbox, main view,** and **property panel**.
![alt text](../uploads/pictures/sections2.png "Sections")
> **_Note: Consider another layout for labels in the picture._**
##### Customizing Panels
Panels can be relocated for major convenience by using the _drag and drop_ principle. Also, all panels can be turned ON or OFF: 
* By clicking on the **X** sign on the top right corner, 
* By using shortcuts (**_Toolbox > Alt + X, Workspace: Alt + W, etc._**), 
* Or through the toolbar View menu: **_View > Toolbar, View > Properties, etc._**

#### Toolbar
The toolbar provides the main features that are available at a given moment. A view resides in the center and occupies all available area in the screen. There are some static controls, such as **File > Import File**, and controls that are specific for the active view.

#### Main Menus
The static menus offer basic functionalities that are common to all the environments. Moreover, some view specific menus appear when data is imported. At any moment, only the usable features appear as clickable.

#### Ribbons
The ribbons menu is a quick access icon toolbar located under the static and view-specific menus. Before you import or connect to data, the available options are **Open/Save local file, Connect to Data,** and **Show Workspace**.
![alt text](../uploads/gifs/ribbons.gif "Ribbons Menu")
However, the quick access ribbons change depending on the available options. For instance, these are the features when you have already imported data to the workspace.
