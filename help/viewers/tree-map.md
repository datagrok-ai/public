# Tree Map

Tree maps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of
the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-
branches. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to a specified dimension of the data.
