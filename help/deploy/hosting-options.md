Depending on the needs of your organizations, choose the option that works best for your organization.

## SaaS

We take care of everything!

## On-premise

Datagrok servers are hosted within your organizations' network.

* Control where the data is stored
* Directly connect to databases
* Browse network shares
* Use other resources on the network (such as images)
* Authenticate using Active Directory

## Hybrid

A hybrid hosting model is also possible. For instance, it is possible to get the web app from Datagrok's servers (so
that you are always using the latest version), while still using your own infrastructure for data storage, and hosting
the data access server within the network so that the data never leaves your organization.
