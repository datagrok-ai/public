# 2021-10-14 0.94.0

We've released a [new version](https://public.datagrok.ai/) of the Datagrok platform (0.94.0). This
release focuses on the areas of visualization, usability, rich features for the developers, and
traditionally on the platform stability.

## Visualization and usability improvements

* Many updates in Scatter plot:
  a [lasso tool](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/extensions-to-the-scatter-plot-viewer/481/5), axis
  sliders, data split
  by [marker](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/20) [shape](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/22)
  , custom lines by equations; all summarized
  in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=3018s)
* New Histogram features: splines and
  bands: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=3490s)
* New Line Chart features: marker shape selection,
  whiskers: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=3562s)
* Using “Relative Values” property in combination with the “Stack” property to analyze the
  distribution of the stacked
  values: [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/bar-chart-updates/580)
* Many aspects and issues of the Bar Chart
  addressed: [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/piechart-issues/569/3)
* Search for category names in filters (useful when there are many categories in the column): more
  in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=3642s) +
  an [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/21)
* Lists in parameterized database
  queries: [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/lists-in-parameterized-database-queries/597)
  + [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meRAEF7ogtw); also check the video about parameterized
    queries in general: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSJp5CXcYKQ)
* Database query caching with cron jobs
  ability: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=3984s)

## Improvements for developers

* More granular event handling (an example with intercepting conditional color coding settings
  change: [link](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/12))
* Creating drag-and-drop
  objects: [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/13)
* Getting cell colors: [overview](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/14)
* Adding custom machine learning models to Datagrok in R, Python, or from external models deployed
  in clusters: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G66MN30ZPGQ)
  , [package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/labs/tree/master/packages/CustomML)
  , [help](https://datagrok.ai/help/learn/custom-machine-learning-models)

## Enhancements in public packages

* [PowerPack and Universal Search](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/PowerPack)
  — commonly used platform enhancements, currently covering Start Page widgets, Power Search (
  ability to search for anything from the Start Screen), and search templates
  support: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=86s)
* Updates in the [Peptides](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Peptides)
  package, learn more in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=2390s)

We have also redesigned our approach to interactive Tutorials. We have moved them to a
standalone [package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Tutorials) and made
them available through a dedicated [app](https://public.datagrok.ai/apps).
Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3Dn5NSDSEY&t=1920s) to get a grasp. Every
tutorial on the platform now is a simple TypeScript code,
like [here](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Tutorials/src/tracks/chem/tutorials)
. Now it is possible to equip customers' apps and deployments of Datagrok with tutorials as well!

## 2021-07-29 0.93.0

We've released a [new version](https://public.datagrok.ai/) of the Datagrok platform (0.93.0). It's
a large release with many new features and stability improvements, addressing both user experience
and flexibility for developers.

Here are some interesting areas in the platform updates:

* Viewers improvements, such
  as [relative values in Bar Charts] (https://community.datagrok.ai/t/bar-chart-updates/580)
  or [multi-axis Line Chart](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/18)
* Visual improvements
  like [dragging columns with drop zones](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/17)
  and [cleaner columns summaries in tooltips]( https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/16)
* Functional features, such
  as [filtering multivalue cells](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/15)
* Improvements in [sharing files and folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QxzllnBreI&t=3895s)
* Better programmatic operations, such
  as [more granular event handling for metadata](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/15)
  and
  [new customizations in Scatter Plot](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/11)

## 2021-04-14 Dev build 0.89.36

In this release, we've focused on enriching both the experience of the platform end users and on-platform developers, as
well as on connecting these two groups. For instance, custom-built cell renderers, useful for displaying molecules,
nucleotide sequences or experiments results, now expand the platform in many places such
as [tooltips and tile viewers](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/cheminformatics-updates/457/8). There are
also [new viewers](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/4)
, [several bar chart](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/bar-chart-color-by-category/516) [features](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/10)
, [color coding features](https://dev.datagrok.ai/js/samples/grid/color-coding-conditional), and a few dozen
of [JS API](https://datagrok.ai/help/govern/audit#javascript-api) [enhancements](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/8)
and [bugfixes](#bugfixes).

## 2020.05.27 Stable version

### What's new

#### JavaScript API changed. Use `datagrok-api` npm package as a code reference.

Now API have 3 entry points:

* `DG` contains complete API code
* `grok` is the main entry point to start using API for most of the tasks
* `ui` is for constructing UI

Here is how code changes:

```
grok.t => grok.shell.t
grok.v => grok.shell.v
grok.tables => grok.shell.tables
grok.presentationMode => grok.shell.presentationMode
grok.parseCsv => grok.data.parseCsv
GrokPackage => DG.Package
TYPE_FLOAT => DG.TYPE.FLOAT
```

Please, refer to the [JavaScript examples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js) to migrate your code. See also:

* [Developing packages](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/develop)

* [EXIF](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Samples/scripts/python/exif.py)

#### First class support of command-line Interface tools for Linux in scripting:

* [CLI](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/labs/tree/master/packages/CLI)
* [Tika](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/labs/tree/master/packages/Tika)
