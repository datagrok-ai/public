## 2024-11-04 Datagrok 1.21.4  

### Improvements and fixes:
* Bugfixes for model signatures synchronization
* Text Renderer: Fixed multi-line link rendering

## 2024-09-10 Datagrok 1.21.1 release 

The Datagrok 1.21.1 release enhances platform stability and usability, streamlining workflows for a more intuitive user experience. 

Database migrations are irreversible in this version. You cannot roll back to an older version of Datagrok after the first 1.21.0 run. If a rollback is necessary, please contact Datagrok support for assistance.

### Input API breaking change:
  - The methods of `DG.InputBase` (such as `onInput` and `onChanged`) have been updated. They are now of the `Observable` type (previously they were `Stream`). To subscribe to these events, you will need to update your code from `input.onChanged(() => change());` to `input.onChanged.subscribe(() => change());` (same for `onInput`).
  - Additionally, when creating an input via the `ui.input.xxx` namespace and passing the `onValueChanged` parameter in the options, the parameters for `onValueChanged` have changed. Previously, they were `(input: DG.InputBase<T>)`, but now they are `(value: T, input: DG.InputBase<T>)`. If you don't need the entire input object, you can simply use the `value` parameter in the method.

### Main:

* Lightweight modeling improvements: Interactive dashboard for training predictive models.

## 2023-04-18 1.14.0

We've launched a new version of the Datagrok platform (1.14.0). This release focuses on improving data access speed and convenience, new visualization and usability features, and ensuring platform stability. Here are some of the biggest improvements made in this release:

* New version of Grok Connect with a completely redesigned data delivery system. Thanks to streaming, you can now work with large data volumes and receive data as the query is being executed.
* [Biostructure Viewer](#biostructureviewer) package for interactive exploration of biological structures. For details, see [Biostructure Viewer](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/macromolecules-updates/661/14).
* New user-designed cell forms feature that allows you to include more details in cells, displaying additional values alongside the cell content. In-grid forms also inherit the color-coding scheme of the grid, enabling you to view even more additional information in the cell.
* [Tile Viewer]( https://public.datagrok.ai/apps/Tutorials/Demo/Viewers/Tile%20Viewer) supporting swimlanes mode, where you can drag and drop cards between lanes.
* Completely redesigned [table link editor](../../transform/link-tables.md).
* Improvement in the function execution efficiency with a significant performance boost of 10x, specifically in formula calculations.
* Multiple improvements in plugins, such as [Chem](#chem), [Bio](#bio), [Helm](#helm), [Peptides](#peptides), [Dendrogram](#dendrogram).

### Visualization and usability improvements

* Core viewers now render molecular structures in the legend marking them with their corresponding colors.
* Placed a hint in the form of three dots (...) in the corner of an element to trigger the context menu when clicked.
* Added a scroll bar in the context menu to handle options that do not fit on the screen.
* For all dialogs that require selecting a molecular column, it is now set as the initial option.
* Ability to select and import multiple files at once using the **Open local file** dialog.
* Consistently reorganized viewers' properties in the **Context pane**:
	 * Moved **Label orientation** to the **Style** tab for PC plot and the other viewers with this property.
   * Moved **Segments Font** to the **Style** tab for line chart.
   * Moved tooltip properties from **Misc** to **Tooltip** and column properties from **Misc** to **Columns** for heatmap and grid.
   * Renamed `Point` to `Line` for PC plot
   * Reordered the properties of the viewers in a way that ensures they use the same order of categories.
* [Grid](../../visualize/viewers/grid.md):
  * Ability to add info panels as columns in the grid.
  * Implemented the column-based edit permissions. Now you can set different editing permissions for each column based on user roles or other criteria.
  * Implemented the ability to view the column's private tags by clicking the **Show private** button (**Context Pane** > **Details**).
  * Added the capability for users to design their own tooltips specific to each column.
  * Implemented a warning that displays the reason why a read-only cell cannot be edited when a user attempts to start editing it.
  *  Implemented the ability to specify columns for in-grid [Default Forms](../../visualize/viewers/grid.md#summary-columns) (**Context Menu** > **Add** > **Forms** > **Default HTML**).
  * Improved default scientific format to show two digits after comma.
  * Fixed:
    * The issue where coloring and format changes were resetting unexpectedly upon interacting with filters, if a group tooltip was set
    * Table is not rendered properly after switching dataframe after sorting data in a column
    * An error when double-clicking on a column header.
* [Filter Panel](../../visualize/viewers/filters.md):
  * Added the ability to drag-and-drop custom filters to the filter panel.
  * Now filters use column format in the tooltip for dates.
  * Consolidated filters application across different tabs so that the behavior is intuitive to users. The **Reset** button resets all filters in the analysis:
      * Turns all filters on.
      * Clears all selected options.
      * Clears visualization filters (e.g. scatterplot color label or `filter by zoom`)
      * Turning on / off a filter makes it turned on /off across all tabs
      * Turning off a filter makes the filter inactive but its selection remains set
  * Fixed:
    * The list of filters becomes empty in **Reorder Filters** dialog
    * Filters synchronization when clicking the **Clear** button
    * Filters re-ordering dialog is not opened if a custom filter was added to filters panel
    * The usability of range filters when min/max values existing in the table were shown instead of actually set range
    * Slow filtering if there are multiple bar charts on several views.
* [Scatter plot](../../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md):
  * Now it displays legend labels for conditional coloring.
  * Added date picker for X and Y axes min/max values.
  * Harmonized the scatter plot context menu:
    * Renamed **Drop Lines** to **Show Drop Lines**.
    * Renamed **Regression Line** to **Show Regression Line**.
    * Added a checkbox for toggling **Rectangle/Lasso selection**.
    * Added **Label Color As Marker** to **Context menu** > **Markers**.
    * Now, we've disabled marker type when the marker axis is defined.
  * Made some improvements for **Formula Lines** on the scatter plot:
    * Formula lines labels are now parallel to lines
    * You can hide the regression lines formula by toggling the corresponding checkbox in the context menu (**Tools** > **Show Regression Lines**)
  * Fixed:
    * Table unexpected filtering if scatter plot has `filter by zoom` setting and empty column on log scale axis
    * Error loading scatter plot for specific data and log scale axes on applying layout
    * Incorrect response on enabling `pack and zoom` option when a numerical column is used
    * The visibility of the selected dot on zooming when it is outside the currently shown range
    * Error loading scatter plot for specific data on applying layout
    * Zoom slider behavior for inverted axes
    * Disappearing of the legend when specific filter is applied.
* [Histogram](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/32):
  * Added the multi-distribution mode: the ability to show markers and a choice of whether or not distributions should be normalized.
  * Added an option to show markers and straight lines for the split mode.
  * Added an option to normalize distribution in  the split mode.
  * Fixed:
     * incorrect behavior when filtering
     * resetting filter when filtering out missing values.
* [Line Chart](../../visualize/viewers/line-chart.md)
  * Now the line chart renders molecule structures on the X axis.
  * Added the zoom slider on the X axis.
  * Fixed:
    * Wrong data is shown on line chart
    * Unsupported operation: NaN.floor() error
    * Incorrect legend for **Split by** when **Row Source** is set to `Selected`
    * Formula lines error
    * Change columns bug.
* For [PC Plot](../../visualize/viewers/pc-plot.md) we've fixed:
   * Density recalculation on normalization or switching columns to log scale
   * Adding Measures in PC plot transformation.
* [Box Plot](../../visualize/viewers/box-plot.md)
  * Added a zoom slider to adjust axes range
  * Harmonized the box plot context menu:
    * Added new menu entries to **Markers**: **Marker Type**, **Marker Size**, **Marker Opacity**, **Show Inside Values**, and **Show Outside Values**.
    * Added menu **Statistics** on the top level with two entries: **Show Statistics** and **Show p-Value**.
    * Added menu Y axis with **Show Value Axis**, **Axis Type**, **Invert Y axis**, and **Show Value Selector**.
    * Added menu X axis with **Show Category Axis**, **Label Orientation**, and **Show Category Selector**.
* [Bar chart](../../visualize/viewers/bar-chart.md)
  * Harmonized the context menu.
  * Implemented a fix that correctly hides the tooltip when the user selects the **Tooltip** > **Hide** option.
*  [Tile Viewer](../../visualize/viewers/tile-viewer.md) now shows long values that are not fully visible in a tooltip.
* Resolved the issue where the  [Trellis Plot](../../visualize/viewers/trellis-plot.md) displayed not all data until a user clicked a bar chart.

### Data Access

  * Error on the **Activity** tab for some connections
  * Snowflake handling of doubles, infinity, -infinity, NaN, and large scale floating point numbers.
  * Exception in parametrized queries with two identical parameter names.
  * Databases | PostgresDart | NorthwindTest: error for the `orders` query.
  * Databases | PostgresDart | ChemblSQL: error on the **Content** tab when clicking the `domains` table.

#### [JS API](../../develop/packages/js-api.md)

* Improvements:
  * Introduced a new feature for application developers. Now you can [place hints](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/javascript-api-updates/526/21) for users in the form of indicators, and popups, as well as describe a series of visual components in the wizard.  UI methods now come equipped with interactive hints, similar to those found in tutorials, that can be attached to various elements. With the addition of these methods, application authors are able to incorporate interactive hints in their app code, allowing them to introduce new features to their users, among other things.
  * To work with custom filters, we've added `.custom-filter-type` and `.ignore-custom-filter` tags . See [column tags](../../visualize/viewers/filters.md#column-tags) to learn more.
  * Provided `typeAhead`, `dropDown` and `breadcrumbs` controls for the platform.
  * Implemented the capability to export graphics of scatter plot to JS API. You can now render scatter plot viewer to an arbitrary graphics context using JS API. Basically, we've made a viewer that works directly with the cell renderer. This means you can now show cells as viewers and manipulate them in other ways too.
  * Added classes for form viewers in the API: `Form` and `FormViewer`.
  * Added the `onViewRemoving` event.
  * Improved the table join feature by adding the option to merge "all columns" without having to list each individual column.
  * Added `DataQuery.connection`.
  * Added JS renderers: `getDefaultSize(gridColumn)`.
  * Exposed the row tooltip of ScatterPlot viewer to JS API
  * Added the `tags` field to `GridColumn` for storing serializable JS objects.
  * Added the `autoHideTabHeader` property to **Accordion**.
  * Balloon: added the ability to pass elements as content
  * Exposed the `Menu.show` options.
  * Grid: exposed `gridRowToTable` and `tableRowToGrid` methods.
* Fixed:
  * Fixed the TableInput reacting to the programmatic value setting.
  * TableInput does not fire onInput when user uses **Open file** button.
  * The ` whereRowMask()` function to correctly apply the mask to the selection.
  * Signatures of `_render` function for all plots with `CanvasViewerMixin`.
  * Color calculation when the data range is 0.

## 2023-01-24 Dev build 1.12.0

We've released a new version of the Datagrok platform (1.12.0). This release focuses on new features for visualization
and usability and traditionally on platform stability.
Here are some of the biggest improvements:

* New [Scaffold Tree](release-history.md#enhancements-in-packages ) visualization that organizes molecular data sets by
  arranging molecules into a tree hierarchy based on their scaffolds. For details,
  see [Scaffold tree](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#scaffold-tree-analysis).
* [Dendrogram](release-history.md#enhancements-in-packages) for interactive exploration of the hierarchical clustering.
  For details, see [Dendrogram](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/dendrogram/721).
* Brand new [Map](release-history.md#enhancements-in-packages). To learn more,
  see [Map viewer](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/27)
* [Peptides](release-history.md#enhancements-in-packages) new features and capabilities, such as custom clustering and
  multiple views, as well as a slightly redesigned user interface and improved application stability. To learn more,
  see [Macromolecules updates](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/macromolecules-updates/661/11)

### Visualization and usability improvements

* Color coding
  * Scatter plot now has a legend for continuous color coding.
  * In a grid, you can apply color coding to the text or
    background. This option is available for all linear, categorical, and conditional schemas.
  * When inheriting the color coding from the grid, adjustments to the min/max made in the plot are reflected in the
    grid. However, if the original column is not color-coded and selected for the color column in the scatter plot, the
    configuration isn't applied to the column in the grid.
  * Fixed changing the linear color scheme issue. Now the null values don't get colored.
  * Fixed inconsistent behavior of color coding checkboxes in the columns context menu.
* [Scatter plot](../../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md):
  * Added the exact min/max of the column on the axes' ticks.
  * Context menu: marker section doesn't close on click.
  * Fixed axis buffer and filters interaction.
* [Bar chart](../../visualize/viewers/bar-chart.md): reordered properties under the Order and Data submenus.
* Formula lines: regarding the line labels, the line title is on the plot, and both title and description are in the
  tooltip.
* We've added radio group identification to menu options where relevant.
* Linked tables:
  * Added the UI to specify multiple columns as key columns.
  * Fixed saving linked tables to the project.

### Enhancements in packages

#### [Chem](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/7c62a0c018ec631d3b23760d538a17aaf4d4ca36/packages/Chem#readme)

We've added new **Scaffold Tree** visualization that organizes molecular data sets by arranging molecules into a tree
hierarchy based on their scaffolds. For details, see [Scaffold tree](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#scaffold-tree-analysis).

* Improvements:
  * Added the package property to [set the default **Sketcher
    **](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chem#sketcher) so that users won't have to switch on
    the first use manually.
  * Changed the result output for **Chem | Find MCS**. Now it returns a variable instead of a column.
  * Improved the handling of invalid molecules and empty inputs.
  * Added support for aromatic bonds when importing MOL2 files.
* Bug fixes:
  * Excluded blank data from **Diversity Search**.
  * Fixed filter: incorrect behavior after **Reset**.
  * Added progress indicator to **Similarity** and **Diversity Search**.
  * Fixed handling tables with a small number of data points when building **Chemical Space**.
  * Fixed 2d molecule orientation in the widget.
  * Fixed **Structural Alerts** detection memory leak.
  * Fixed Elemental Analysis working on MOLV3000.
  * Provided permanent fix for shared canvas re-allocation in the `rdkit-cell-renderer`.
  * Synchronized the selection and deselection of activity cliffs on scatter plot and grid.
  * Fixed an error after **Use as Filter** action under the cell with a molecule.

#### [Dendrogram](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Dendrogram#readme)

We've separated **Dendrogram** from [**PhyloTreeViewer
**](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/PhyloTreeViewer). And now it's
a [package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Dendrogram) for the Datagrok platform for
phylogenetic tree visualization.

Use Dendrogram viewer to:

* Display the Newick tree format files (NWK, NEWICK).
* Inject a dendrogram into the grid for interactive exploration of hierarchical clustering.

For details, see [Dendrogram](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/dendrogram/721).

#### [GIS](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/GIS)

We've retired Google Map viewer and implemented a Map viewer in
the GIS package. It shows geospatial data on a map as either markers or a heatmap. It displays data in geographic
formats, like GEOJSON, TOPOJSON, KML, and KMZ. You can also add a map viewer to your custom table. To learn more,
see [Map viewer](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/27).

#### [Peptides](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Peptides#readme)

This release introduces new features and capabilities, such as custom clustering and multiple views, as well as a
slightly redesigned user interface and improved application stability. To learn more,
see [Macromolecules updates](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/macromolecules-updates/661/11)

Improvement:

* Added aggregated columns to the Monomer-Position viewer tooltips. This viewer is used
  in [Peptides SAR](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/bio/peptides-sar.md)

#### [SequenceTranslator](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/SequenceTranslator#readme)

* Improvements:
  * Added adaptive input fields for chains. They resize automatically upon adding longer sequences.
  * Relocated _direction input fields_ to the right of chain input fields.
  * Improved handling of the malformed data. The malformed string is now filled with red color.
  * Added tooltips.
  * Added routing to open specific tabs from links.
* Bug fixes:
  * Fixed rendering _resulting molecule_ with empty AS, AS2.
  * Fixed rendering for separate strands.

#### [Charts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#readme)

We've merged package **Viewers** to **Charts**, removed obsolete viewers, and refactored the others:

* [Sankey viewer](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#sankey):
  * Added a tooltip.
  * Added the selection functionality.
  * Added viewer redrawing on filtering.
  * Fixed focus to highlight the current.object on a viewer
  * Fixed selection on filtered rows.
* [Chord viewer](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#chord):
  * Added viewer redrawing on filtering.
  * Fixed the selection functionality.
* [Radar viewer](../../visualize/viewers/radar.md):
  * Fixed changing color issue: synchronized the color of percentiles on the legend and **Context Pane**.

#### [MLB](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/MolecularLiabilityBrowser#readme)

* VRs tree for grid.
* Revert database connection dataSource `PostgresNet`.
* Fix for routing tree in url.

### Improvements for developers

#### [Viewers](../../develop/how-to/develop-custom-viewer.md)

* Added the ability to specify default viewer settings for the dataframe,
  see [annotation](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/1395#issuecomment-1364325511).
* Added the ability to show a custom viewer in the Viewers section of the toolbox. The viewer should have an icon (set
  via `meta.icon tag`). Toolbox visibility can be specified as `meta.toolbox: true`.

#### [JS API](../../develop/packages/js-api.md)

* Improvements:
  * Added optional parameters to `Column.meta.colors.setLinear()` to set min and max values for linear color coding
    scale.You can also use the `COLOR_CODING_SCHEME_MIN` and `COLOR_CODING_SCHEME_MAX` tags.
  * Added radioGroup to Menu.item.
  * Added the ability to set `friendlyName` for `DataConnections` created from JS API.
  * Added hints to UI methods. The purpose is to attach interactive hints, close to what happens in tutorials, to
    elements. Application developers can then use these methods in the app code to introduce a new feature to the user,
    etc.
  * JS Viewers: disabled the removal of the default values (this likely fixes the issue with the JS properties not
    serialized).
  * Exposed schema property for `DataConnection`.
* Bug fixes:
  * `ui.choiceInput` does not work with strings that contain `\r` symbol.
  * Failure to get meta data from `SemanticValue` in JS.
  * Fixed date in `getValues()` in stock-broker.js.
  * Fixed `Project.removeChild` method.

#### [Widgets](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/7c62a0c018ec631d3b23760d538a17aaf4d4ca36/packages/Widgets#readme)

* Added the ability to create a custom package settings widget.
* `Widget.getType()` method major code cleanup.

#### Enhancements in libraries

* [utils](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/libraries/utils#readme):
  * Input categories added in the input form.
  * Added basic validation, btn disabling and UI fixes to **RichFunctionView**.
  * **RichFunctionView**: run button disabling added.
  * Move distance methods and constants to **ML lib** (utils), remove `index.ts`.
  * Exclude blank data from diversity search.
  * Utils for color.
* [ml](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/libraries/ml#readme):
  * Moved distance methods from **Chem**, **Bio**, **MLB** to **ML lib**.
  * Fixed **Activity Cliffs** page freezing bug.
  * Fixed **Stochastic Proximity Embedding** dialog does not work.
  * Handled errors from web workers.
* [bio](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/libraries/bio#readme):
  * Clear **Bio** lib dependency on **Phylocanvas**.
  * Separate **Dendrogram** package.
  * Fix dendrogram interfaces to allow emp.
  * Added `ITreeHelper.getNodesByLeaves`.

### [Compute](../../compute/compute.md)

* Improvements:
  * `RichFunctionView` renamed and stabilized.
  * Added script generator app example.
  * Added sample of high-order function.
* Bug fixes:
  * Fixed linking to `RichFunctionView`.

### Other bug fixes

* Actions in packages don't support semantic values.
* Connections: Fixed anonymous mode.
