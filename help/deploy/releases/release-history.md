## 2025-10-22 Datagrok 1.26.5 release

### Improvements and fixes:

* Added support for SAML authentication
* Introduced support for user account impersonation in Google Cloud Storage
* Projects: Added support for saving projects created via custom scripts with data synchronization

## 2025-07-25 Datagrok 1.26.0 release

The Datagrok 1.26.0 release focuses on improved data access and collaboration, enhanced visualization capabilities, and navigation UI/UX improvements.

### Breaking changes

This release introduces non-backward-compatible database changes. You can upgrade to version 1.26.0 automatically; however, once you migrate the database, older versions (including 1.25) will no longer be compatible. In case you need to roll back to 1.25.N, you must manually revert the changes or restore a pre-upgrade backup

### Main updates

* Introducing **Spaces**, a new section in **Browse** that helps you organize, access, and share projects, files, folders, connections, and other frequently used items, making collaboration easier
* Enhanced **Power Search** on the **Home Page** now lets you quickly find tables, queries, functions, projects, and help topics all from one place
* A new **Home Page** widget, **Activity Dashboard**, provides a unified view of recent activity, shared items, favorites, personal actions, and notifications, so you can easily track and access key updates
* **Complex calculated columns**: you can now use a single vector function to generate multiple columns in one step, so you no longer have to add each column manually
* **Python Celery task wrapper** enables seamless integration of Python Docker applications with Datagrok,
running Python functions as Celery tasks in isolated containers while the platform handles orchestration, task queuing, and results. For details, see [Creating Python Docker apps](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/how-to/packages/python-functions)

### Platform

* [#2835](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/2835): Data-Link Tables: Enabled editing of data-link tables without needing to unlink them
* [#2919](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/2919): Added support for capture groups in regular expressions
* [#3346](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/3346): Added option to export selected dataframe as SDF with customization
* Provided the possibility to send email notifications with membership requests
* Added the ability to restrict sharing within user groups
* Enabled custom function call editors that integrate into the Datagrok UI, allowing tailored parameter input forms. For details, see [Custom function editors](https://datagrok.ai/help/datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation#custom-function-editors)
  
* Fixed: 
  * [#3325](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/3325): CSV Export: Pinned columns are not saved when "Visible Columns Only" is enabled 
  * [#2654](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/2654): Projects: Error when using joining table function  
  * [#3127](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/3127): Projects: Datasync joined tables error when reopened in project/dashboard  
  * [#3269](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/3269): XLSX files with multiple sheets: data sync is only provided for the first sheet  
  * [#3300](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/3300): Projects: Data sync save setting resets to OFF after reopening saved data sync project  
  * Find and Replace: Finding all empty values is not supported  
  * Float column formats: Some different formats look the same in examples  
  
#### Browse

* Browse tree navigation improvements: the selected directory is now sticky, so it stays in view when you navigate between sections, making it easier to keep your context while browsing
* Redesigned Docker UX with added **Resources**, **Logs**, and **Build logs** sections for easier container management and monitoring

### [JS API](https://datagrok.ai/help/develop/js-api)

* Added the alias for 'memberships', addressing the previous limitation that required using group.parents in the JavaScript API. For details, see [how to get a list of users](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/how-to-delete-users-from-grok-server/613/7)

### Improvements and fixes:

## 2024-09-10 Datagrok 1.21.1 release 

The Datagrok 1.21.1 release enhances platform stability and usability, streamlining workflows for a more intuitive user experience. 

Database migrations are irreversible in this version. You cannot roll back to an older version of Datagrok after the first 1.21.0 run. If a rollback is necessary, please contact Datagrok support for assistance.

### Input API breaking change:
  - The methods of `DG.InputBase` (such as `onInput` and `onChanged`) have been updated. They are now of the `Observable` type (previously they were `Stream`). To subscribe to these events, you will need to update your code from `input.onChanged(() => change());` to `input.onChanged.subscribe(() => change());` (same for `onInput`).
  - Additionally, when creating an input via the `ui.input.xxx` namespace and passing the `onValueChanged` parameter in the options, the parameters for `onValueChanged` have changed. Previously, they were `(input: DG.InputBase<T>)`, but now they are `(value: T, input: DG.InputBase<T>)`. If you don't need the entire input object, you can simply use the `value` parameter in the method.

### Main:

* Lightweight modeling improvements: Interactive dashboard for training predictive models.

## 2023-01-24 Dev build 1.12.0

We've released a new version of the Datagrok platform (1.12.0). This release focuses on new features for visualization
and usability and traditionally on platform stability.
Here are some of the biggest improvements:

* New [Scaffold Tree](release-history.md#enhancements-in-packages ) visualization that organizes molecular data sets by
  arranging molecules into a tree hierarchy based on their scaffolds. For details,
  see [Scaffold tree](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#scaffold-tree-analysis).

### Visualization and usability improvements

* Color coding
  * Scatter plot now has a legend for continuous color coding.
  * In a grid, you can apply color coding to the text or
    background. This option is available for all linear, categorical, and conditional schemas.
  * When inheriting the color coding from the grid, adjustments to the min/max made in the plot are reflected in the
    grid. However, if the original column is not color-coded and selected for the color column in the scatter plot, the
    configuration isn't applied to the column in the grid.
  * Fixed changing the linear color scheme issue. Now the null values don't get colored.
  * Fixed inconsistent behavior of color coding checkboxes in the columns context menu.
* [Scatter plot](../../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md):
  * Added the exact min/max of the column on the axes' ticks.
  * Context menu: marker section doesn't close on click.
  * Fixed axis buffer and filters interaction.
* [Bar chart](../../visualize/viewers/bar-chart.md): reordered properties under the Order and Data submenus.
* Formula lines: regarding the line labels, the line title is on the plot, and both title and description are in the
  tooltip.
* We've added radio group identification to menu options where relevant.
* Linked tables:
  * Added the UI to specify multiple columns as key columns.
  * Fixed saving linked tables to the project.

### Enhancements in packages

#### [Chem](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/7c62a0c018ec631d3b23760d538a17aaf4d4ca36/packages/Chem#readme)

We've added new **Scaffold Tree** visualization that organizes molecular data sets by arranging molecules into a tree
hierarchy based on their scaffolds. For details, see [Scaffold tree](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#scaffold-tree-analysis).

* Improvements:
  * Added the package property to [set the default **Sketcher
    **](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chem#sketcher) so that users won't have to switch on
    the first use manually.
  * Changed the result output for **Chem | Find MCS**. Now it returns a variable instead of a column.
  * Improved the handling of invalid molecules and empty inputs.
  * Added support for aromatic bonds when importing MOL2 files.
* Bug fixes:
  * Excluded blank data from **Diversity Search**.
  * Fixed filter: incorrect behavior after **Reset**.
  * Added progress indicator to **Similarity** and **Diversity Search**.
  * Fixed handling tables with a small number of data points when building **Chemical Space**.
  * Fixed 2d molecule orientation in the widget.
  * Fixed **Structural Alerts** detection memory leak.
  * Fixed Elemental Analysis working on MOLV3000.
  * Provided permanent fix for shared canvas re-allocation in the `rdkit-cell-renderer`.
  * Synchronized the selection and deselection of activity cliffs on scatter plot and grid.
  * Fixed an error after **Use as Filter** action under the cell with a molecule.

#### [Dendrogram](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Dendrogram#readme)

We've separated **Dendrogram** from [**PhyloTreeViewer
**](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/PhyloTreeViewer). And now it's
a [package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Dendrogram) for the Datagrok platform for
phylogenetic tree visualization.

Use Dendrogram viewer to:

* Display the Newick tree format files (NWK, NEWICK).
* Inject a dendrogram into the grid for interactive exploration of hierarchical clustering.

For details, see [Dendrogram](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/dendrogram/721).

#### [GIS](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/GIS)

We've retired Google Map viewer and implemented a Map viewer in
the GIS package. It shows geospatial data on a map as either markers or a heatmap. It displays data in geographic
formats, like GEOJSON, TOPOJSON, KML, and KMZ. You can also add a map viewer to your custom table. To learn more,
see [Map viewer](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/visualization-related-updates/521/27).

#### [Peptides](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Peptides#readme)

This release introduces new features and capabilities, such as custom clustering and multiple views, as well as a
slightly redesigned user interface and improved application stability. To learn more,
see [Macromolecules updates](https://community.datagrok.ai/t/macromolecules-updates/661/11)

Improvement:

* Added aggregated columns to the Monomer-Position viewer tooltips. This viewer is used
  in [Peptides SAR](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/bio/peptides-sar.md)

#### [SequenceTranslator](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/SequenceTranslator#readme)

* Improvements:
  * Added adaptive input fields for chains. They resize automatically upon adding longer sequences.
  * Relocated _direction input fields_ to the right of chain input fields.
  * Improved handling of the malformed data. The malformed string is now filled with red color.
  * Added tooltips.
  * Added routing to open specific tabs from links.
* Bug fixes:
  * Fixed rendering _resulting molecule_ with empty AS, AS2.
  * Fixed rendering for separate strands.

#### [Charts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#readme)

We've merged package **Viewers** to **Charts**, removed obsolete viewers, and refactored the others:

* [Sankey viewer](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#sankey):
  * Added a tooltip.
  * Added the selection functionality.
  * Added viewer redrawing on filtering.
  * Fixed focus to highlight the current.object on a viewer
  * Fixed selection on filtered rows.
* [Chord viewer](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Charts#chord):
  * Added viewer redrawing on filtering.
  * Fixed the selection functionality.
* [Radar viewer](../../visualize/viewers/radar.md):
  * Fixed changing color issue: synchronized the color of percentiles on the legend and **Context Pane**.

#### MLB

* VRs tree for grid.
* Revert database connection dataSource `PostgresNet`.
* Fix for routing tree in url.

### Improvements for developers

#### [Viewers](../../develop/how-to/viewers/develop-custom-viewer.md)

* Added the ability to specify default viewer settings for the dataframe,
  see [annotation](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/issues/1395#issuecomment-1364325511).
* Added the ability to show a custom viewer in the Viewers section of the toolbox. The viewer should have an icon (set
  via `meta.icon tag`). Toolbox visibility can be specified as `meta.toolbox: true`.

#### [JS API](../../develop/packages/js-api.md)

* Improvements:
  * Added optional parameters to `Column.meta.colors.setLinear()` to set min and max values for linear color coding
    scale.You can also use the `COLOR_CODING_SCHEME_MIN` and `COLOR_CODING_SCHEME_MAX` tags.
  * Added radioGroup to Menu.item.
  * Added the ability to set `friendlyName` for `DataConnections` created from JS API.
  * Added hints to UI methods. The purpose is to attach interactive hints, close to what happens in tutorials, to
    elements. Application developers can then use these methods in the app code to introduce a new feature to the user,
    etc.
  * JS Viewers: disabled the removal of the default values (this likely fixes the issue with the JS properties not
    serialized).
  * Exposed schema property for `DataConnection`.
* Bug fixes:
  * `ui.choiceInput` does not work with strings that contain `\r` symbol.
  * Failure to get meta data from `SemanticValue` in JS.
  * Fixed date in `getValues()` in stock-broker.js.
  * Fixed `Project.removeChild` method.

#### [Widgets](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/7c62a0c018ec631d3b23760d538a17aaf4d4ca36/packages/Widgets#readme)

* Added the ability to create a custom package settings widget.
* `Widget.getType()` method major code cleanup.

#### Enhancements in libraries

* [utils](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/libraries/utils#readme):
