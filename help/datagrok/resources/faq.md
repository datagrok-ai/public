[Table view](../../datagrok/navigation/views/table-view.md) | [Forms](../../visualize/viewers/forms.md) 

Users can configure coloring, highlighting, and switch between compounds as rows or columns, and filter, search, and sort the data. [Common actions](../../datagrok/navigation/views/table-view.md#common-actions) | [Substructure search](../../datagrok/solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#substructure-search--filtering)

##### <b>Q: How can I ingest raw assay data into Datagrok?</b>

Raw data can be ingested through multiple channels, including drag-and-drop, [file shares](../../access/files/files.md#file-sharing-and-access-control), 
[database connections](../../access/databases/databases.md#connecting-to-database), [OpenAPI](../../access/open-api.md), and integrations with services like 
Benchling or Revvity Signals. Datagrok is developing a Plates application
to support predefined plate templates, batch ingestion, and
integrated analysis in one place.

##### <b>Q: How can I perform curve fitting, normalization, QC calculations from raw assay data in Datagrok?</b>

The [Curves](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Curves/README.md)
plugin provides a complete workflow for converting raw assay data into fitted curves with QC
calculations. It transforms well-level assay data into fitted dose–response curves, supporting
functions such as 4PL and sigmoid, and can be easily extended to additional analyses, including
Km/Vmax, dose ratio, melt curves (DSF Tm), and qPCR, by defining the corresponding functions
and parameters.

For modeling dynamic systems, see the [Diff-Studio](../../compute/diff-studio.md) plugin that
allows users to solve sets of differential equations interactively through an intuitive UI and 
a declarative approach. 

##### <b>Q: Can Datagrok visualize dose-response curves for multiple compounds?</b> 

Datagrok supports visualizing DR curves for multiple compounds simultaneously and allows plotting curves using custom equations and parameters on the fly (e.g., 4-parameter curve fit over a 10-point dose-response).

  multi-layered testing including unit, integration, UI, and performance tests.  
  [Learn more](../../develop/qa/quality-assurance.md#continuous-integration-and-deployment-system) | [Testing](../../develop/qa/quality-assurance.md#automated-testing)

* Secure development lifecycle – CI/CD pipelines enforce automated build, test,
  and security checks; semantic versioning; and secure credential management.  
  [Learn more](../../develop/develop.md#continuous-integration) | [Version control](../../develop/dev-process/versioning-policy) | [Credential management](../../develop/how-to/packages/manage-credentials.md)

### Governance & access 

#### Authentication & authorization 

##### <b>Q: How does Datagrok handle authentication and authorization?</b>

Datagrok uses role-based access control and integrates with enterprise identity
providers such as LDAP, SSO, and OAuth. 
[Learn more about access control](../../govern/access-control/access-control.md)

##### <b>Q: Is data in Datagrok restricted to users with proper permissions?</b>

Yes. Data is accessible only to users with appropriate permissions, supporting cross-project access and differentiation between internal and external (CRO) users. See [User permissions](../solutions/teams/it/security.md#user-permissions) and [Authorization](../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#authorization).

##### <b>Q: Who has access to Bitbucket, and what are the authentication requirements?</b>

Only datagrok core developers have access. MFA is being enabled to strengthen authentication. Bitbucket also provides built-in security scanning features.  

##### <b>Q: How is MFA enforced for GitHub accounts?</b>

GitHub requires all code contributors to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) as of March 2023. Developers comply by using device-tied passcodes.  

#### Data privacy & usage 

##### <b>Q: What happens to my data when I open a local file in Datagrok?</b>

When you open a local file in Datagrok (like dragging and dropping a file to your browser), you can analyze it without saving. This data stays in your browser's memory and isn't sent to the server unless you run resource-intensive server-side computations. Your data is gone when you close the browser tab. To save your work, you need to upload it to the server. Note that uploading data does not make it accessible to others. Your data stays private and visible to you only until you explicitly share it. Learn how to [save](../concepts/project/project.md#saving-entities-to-projects) and [share](../navigation/basic-tasks/basic-tasks.md#share) data.

##### <b>Q: What data or telemetry is sent back to Datagrok? What egress ports/protocols are used?</b>

* No automatic telemetry: Datagrok does not send any data to Datagrok servers by default.
* Optional error report/feedback: Users can optionally send feedback or error reports to Datagrok by selecting the "Send report to Datagrok" checkbox in the corresponding dialog.
* Package/image pulls: Datagrok can download images from Docker Hub or packages from NPM.
* Your connectors: Any external calls come from plugins you install (e.g., APIs, databases) over their standard ports/protocols.


### Data security 

#### Encryption 

##### <b>Q: Is data encrypted at rest?</b>

Yes, Datagrok relies on Amazon's built-in encryption for [RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html) and [S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html).

##### <b>Q: Is data encrypted in transit?</b>

Yes, all client-server communications use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), which means it is secure and encrypted. 

#### Vulnerability & patch management 

##### <b>Q: How do you manage vulnerabilities in the application and cloud infrastructure?</b>

We monitor CISA alerts and run daily [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) scans on container
builds. Vulnerabilities are triaged, remediated via infrastructure-as-code
pipelines, and verified through CI/CD testing. Customers are notified and
supported in version upgrades as needed. Learn more about
[Infrastructure](../../develop/under-the-hood/infrastructure.md)

##### <b>Q: How are OS and server patching handled?</b>

Jenkins and development servers are rebuilt quarterly with a fresh OS.
Documentation for builds is maintained in internal repositories. Learn more about [Deployment](../../deploy/deploy.md)

### Endpoint & device security 

#### Device controls 

##### <b>Q: What controls mitigate risks on BYOD devices?</b>

We have a policy that all devices must have active malware protection, updated
signatures, and drive encryption enabled.  

##### <b>Q: How is data exfiltration via removable media prevented?</b>

We have a policy that sensitive data must not be stored on removable media.
Passwords or credentials must not be transmitted unencrypted.  

#### EDR 

##### <b>Q: What is Datagrok’s current EDR approach?</b>

No dedicated EDR is deployed on associates’ devices. However, all devices must
have up-to-date and active malware protection. Associates are required to report
any suspicious activity via the alert channel. Incident response team triages
and executes the incident management process.  

##### <b>Q: How are security logs collected and monitored?</b>

AWS resources use centralized logging. Currently, there is no proactive log
review, but reporting of failed logins with alert thresholds is being
implemented.  

## Transform

##### <b>Q: Can I add a calculated column from a user interface?</b>

Yes. The [Add new column](../../transform/add-new-column.md) feature is very powerful. You can: 

* write your own expressions manually
* use 500+ available [functions](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/functions.md), or
* add your own functions using custom packages and scripts. 

For example, from a SMILES column you can generate molecular properties (e.g., MW, cLogP) or ADMET predictions.
