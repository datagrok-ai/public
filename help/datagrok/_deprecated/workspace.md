Workspace is a collection of currently opened projects.

## Workspace tree

Workspace Tree is a hierarchical viewer that is used for navigating and managing [projects](../concepts/project/project.md),
[tables](../concepts/table.md), [connections](../../access/access.md#data-connection), and other entities.

Use drag-and-drop to move entities between projects. When you open a project, you can
find it added to workspace tree. Close project using context menu to remove it. When you open data or run query, or job,
or script, that produces table - it will be added to scratchpad too. You can remove it using "Remove from project"
context menu. Tables and views must be placed in scratchpad or in another project, so, when you remove table or view
from project - it moves to scratchpad, When you remove table from scratchpad - it closes.

[Scratchpad](scratchpad.md) is a special place to start your own project. You can add data by opening data files, using
drag-and-drop or running queries, then save everything and share with other users. You can exclude entities from project
using context menu, or drag them to another project.

To upload project press _upload_ button in toolbar, or use "Upload" context command.
