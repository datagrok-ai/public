title: "Select tooltip columns"

Select columns that should be put on a tooltip when the mouse cursor is over a data point. By default, all columns are
shown, if the table contains less than 21 columns, and no columns are shown, if a table contains 21 columns or more.

## Viewer tooltips

One of the unique [exploratory data analysis](../solutions/workflows/eda.md)-related features of Datagrok is the ability
to interactively visualize
_group of rows_ on an arbitrary viewer when the mouse is over a visual that represents multiple rows.

Here are some examples of such visuals:

* Bars in a [histogram](../../visualize/viewers/histogram.md)
* Bars in a [bar chart](viewers/bar-chart.md)
* Segments and legend items in a [pie chart](../../visualize/viewers/pie-chart.md)
* Category labels in a [trellis plot](../../visualize/viewers/trellis-plot.md)
* Rectangular areas in a [tree map](../../visualize/viewers/tree-map.md)
* Nodes and edges in a [network diagram](../../visualize/viewers/network-diagram.md)
* Words in a [word cloud](../../visualize/viewers/word-cloud.md)
* Categories and histogram bins in a [filter](../../visualize/viewers/filters.md).

You can choose any viewer as a tooltip for the so-called "mouse-over rows". To do that, add a viewer of interest (such
as scatter plot), customize the settings accordingly, and then select **Tooltip | Use as group tooltip**. After that,
once a mouse cursor gets over the segment that represents multiple rows, a scatter plot containing only mouse-over rows
will be shown in a tooltip.

"Reset group tooltip" removes group tooltip.
