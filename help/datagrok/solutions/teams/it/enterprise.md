title: "Datagrok for Enterprise IT"
---

Software is eating the world, and IT has become a critical competence in all businesses. Datagrok enables IT to become a
partner with business by solving business problems, while at the same time providing enterprise-grade security,
governance, and other IT-controlled mechanisms for storage administration, backup, and audit.

## Security

Give the right access to the right people. We offer several
[authentication](../../../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#authentication) and [authorization](../../../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#authorization) options, as well as role- and group-based
privileges for all objects available in the platform.

## Storage

You are in full control of your data. Pick whatever storage your organization prefers, or mix and match. We support
network file systems, S3, Dropbox, and Google Cloud.

## Governance

Centrally manage all of the data sources, file shares, connections, queries, and reports in one place. Learn what data
is being consumed by business by using data flow analysis and impact analysis tools.

## Deployment

We are completely platform agnostic, you can deploy Datagrok on Linux, Windows, on-premises, in the private cloud, or
use it as a SaaS. To scale scientific computations, spin out as many Grok Compute machines as needed.

## Monitoring

Keep your hand on the platform's pulse by monitoring the performance and efficiency of enterprise systems. Analyze who
does what, which databases are being used, which queries are submitted and how long they take to execute. Get instant
alerts when services are down. Use impact analysis tools to see what will get affected downstream if a particular
component fails.

## Audit

Know exactly what was done, when, and by whom by auditing user activity. Optimize your processes by analyzing system
usage data.

## Integration

From the ground up, Datagrok was designed to be easily extensible by customers. Extension points can be either server-
or client- side, and can be developed in many languages. You can add new queryable data sources using Grok Data API,
build new viewers on top of Datagrok using Grok JS API, or develop custom applications on top of it.

## Administration

Built-in admin tools let you change hundreds of parameters and defaults that are exposed by the platform. Use jobs or
alerts to automate anything.
