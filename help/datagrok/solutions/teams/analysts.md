This page is for business analysts, scientific analysts, and data-savvy domain
experts who need to go from raw data to insight quickly, without waiting on IT
support. Everything below can be done without code. If you're familiar with
Excel, this will feel like Excel on steroids. And if you know SQL or scripting,
you can take it even further.

<!--  See also our page for [data scientists](link). --->

## What you can do

* [Bring data from anywhere](../../datagrok.md#access), including file
  shares/S3, databases, and APIs
* [Query](../../../access/databases/databases.md) databases, [clean and transform](../../datagrok.md#transform) datasets using [500+ functions](../../concepts/functions/functions.md), visually or programmatically 
* [Link](../../../transform/link-tables.md) tables, [aggregate](../../../transform/aggregate-rows.md), [pivot](../../../access/databases/databases.md#visual-query-editor), [compare](../../../transform/compare-tables.md) - with and without code 
* [Slice, dice, and explore your data](../workflows/eda.md). Render
  millions of data points interactively, with [scientific intelligence](../../../visualize/table-view-1#statistical-hypothesis-testing) built-in
* Build [dynamic dashboards](../../../access/databases/databases.md#creating-dynamic-dashboards-for-query-results) in minutes (our [spreadsheet](../../../visualize/viewers/grid.md#rows) and [viewers](../../../visualize/viewers/viewers.md) are best-in-class!)
* [Create custom metadata schemas](../../../govern/catalog/sticky-meta.md) to annotate specific objects within your dataset (like molecules or sequences). Once added, this metadata stays attached to the objects and is accessible across the platform
* Save, search, and reuse [queries](../../../access/databases/databases.md), [scripts](../../../compute/scripting/scripting.mdx), [transformations](../../navigation/panels/panels.md#recording-macros), [layouts](../../../visualize/view-layout.md), and [dashboards](../../concepts/project/dashboard.md)
* [Share](../../navigation/basic-tasks/basic-tasks.md#share) work with other Datagrok users, with [fine-grained permissions](../../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#permissions). [Download](../../navigation/basic-tasks/basic-tasks.md#download) or [embed as an iframe](../../../visualize/table-view-1.md#embed) 
* [Track changes, and understand data lineage](../../datagrok.md#govern)
* [Collaborate](../../datagrok.md#collaborate) across teams
* [Let teams explore data on their own](../workflows/free-world-exploration.md#function-annotations), while maintaining control
