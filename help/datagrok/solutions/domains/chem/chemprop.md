Property prediction plays a key role in drug discovery and materials science, helping researchers estimate characteristics like toxicity, bioactivity, and solubility.

We have now integrated [Chemprop](https://chemprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a PyTorch-based framework, into our platform, enabling easy access with just a few clicks.

## Train

To train a model with Chemprop:

1. **Prepare dataset**  
   - Ensure it includes a column with SMILES or molblocks.
2. **Set up the model**  
   - Go to **ML** > **Models** > **Train Modelâ€¦**.
   - Select dataset, specify the target column (values to predict), and the feature column (SMILES or molblocks).
3. **Choose Chemprop as the model engine**  
   - From available engines, select **Chemprop**.
4. **Adjust model settings**  
   - Configure training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate) and evaluation metrics as needed.
5. **Train model**
   - Click **Train** to start the training process and generate the model.
