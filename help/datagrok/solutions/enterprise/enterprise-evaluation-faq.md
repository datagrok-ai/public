## Encryption at rest

For AWS deployment, we rely on Amazon's built-in encryption for
[RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html)
and
[S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html).

## Encryption in transit

All client-server communications use the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) protocol, which means it is secure
and encrypted.

## Server API

Datagrok client-side uses HTTP rest API to interact with server-side. Authentication token must be passed to access all
features.

## Logging and monitoring

For AWS deployment, we rely on [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) service which provides a
convenient way to collect and observe metrics and logs.

## Backup and restore

Amazon has scheduled backup for RDS and S3, but you can backup and restore RDS database as usual Postgres database.

## Disaster recovery

[Datagrok supports Docker installation, Amazon cluster will immediately restart failed instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFs9RShkHT8)

## Infrastructure as a Code

Datagrok Docker containers are built using Jenkins, all software are upgraded and patched on every build.

Docker-compose manifest is used to describe and deploy Datagrok applications.

Also, there are multiple advanced options to deploy application:

* [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/help/deploy/cloudformation/cloudformation.json)
  to deploy to AWS ECS
* [Terraform scripts](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/help/deploy/terraform/terraform.tf)
to deploy to
  AWS ECS
