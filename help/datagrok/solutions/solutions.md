## Domains

Datagrok core is data-agnostic. Using [plugins](../../develop/how-to/packages/create-package.md), you can 
customize the platform for any domain of knowledge. For example:

* Automatic recognition of domain-specific data types, e.g., molecules
* Highly customized data rendering
* Fast, data-aware spreadsheets and visualizations
* Specialized data editing and filtering interfaces, e.g., substructure filters
* Domain-specific calculation and data processing functions
* Fit-for-purpose apps
