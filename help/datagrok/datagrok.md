## Why Datagrok?

Datagrok helps you understand data and take action.

It's fast and powerful: you can load the entire ChEMBL database (2.7 million
molecules) in your browser, run substructure searches, apply filters, visualize,
and interactively explore the chemical space.

Datagrok goes beyond standard data analytics. You can access data from any
source, catalog it, analyze and visualize it, run scientific computations, train
and apply models, and do more. Need a specific tool or functionality? Easily
integrate or add your own code. Datagrok's plugin architecture makes it easy to
deliver cohesive, fit-for-purpose solutions.

## Who is it for?

**Data**: Datagrok is optimized for structured, tabular data. It automatically
detects the semantics, like zip codes or molecules, and has built-in support
for areas like [cheminformatics](solutions/domains/chem/chem.md),
[bioinformatics](solutions/domains/bio/bio.md), [data science](solutions/domains/data-science.md),
 and others. Need more? Create [your own plugin](../develop/how-to/create-package.md).

**Skillset**: Datagrok is for anyone who works with data: 

* Chemists analyzing SAR tables? [Perfect fit](solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#chemically-aware-spreadsheet).
* Data analysts? Drag and drop your local files to start analyzing. 
* Data scientists mapping new store locations? [Excellent for strategic planning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVwpRB8fikQ).
* Research scientists running complex simulations? [Absolutely](../compute/compute.md).
* Data engineers? Automatically convert queries to [dynamic dashboards](../access/databases/databases.md#creating-dynamic-dashboards-for-query-results), no coding needed. 
* Developers? Quickly develop and test data-driven applications.   

**Team size**: Datagrok is for individuals and teams of all sizes - from
startups<!--insert link to customer stories--> to large enterprises<!--insert link to customer stories-->. The
platform is [enterprise-ready](solutions/enterprise/enterprise.md),
[scalable](../develop/under-the-hood/scaling.md), and ideal for sharing and collaboration.

## What makes it so flexible?

Our mission is to help anyone understand their data, even in complex scenarios:

* Data that's scattered across various data sources
* Data that needs specialized, domain-specific tools
* Teams that have different data needs and expertise. 

Here's how we do it. 

**JS API**: With JS API, you aren't confined to pre-built features or interfaces. Add new
data formats, connectors, transformations, augmentations, dynamic calculations,
UI elements, full-scale applications, workflows, and
[more](../develop/function-roles.md). The API also provides seamless
integration with data sources and other tools, crucial for large enterprises
combatting data silos and complex data ecosystems.

**Functions**: In Datagrok, every task is a
[function](concepts/functions/functions.md) that can be
[annotated](concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md). Annotations make
functions versatile, allowing them to work on their own or within larger
scripts, no matter the function's language or role. This means you can use
functions as blocks to build on your team's collective expertise while fully
leveraging Datagrok's capabilities. (See the cheminformatics example below).

<summary>Example</summary>

In this example, a [Python script based on RDKit](https://public.datagrok.ai/script/276a5929-6f21-5105-8eec-576845aabae0)
calculates and visualizes Gasteiger partial charges. When you run the script
explicitly, Datagrok shows a dialog for sketching a query molecule and
visualizes the results. In this case, however, the script is also tagged as a
`panel`. This instructs Datagrok to show the results as an interactive UI
element that updates dynamically for the current molecule.

**Semantic types**: [Semantic data types](../govern/catalog/semantic-types.md) provide domain-specific customization:

* Automatic detection of domain-specific data types
* Domain-specific menus and context actions
* Custom data rendering, including spreadsheets and visualizations
* Specialized data editing and filtering interfaces
* Domain-specific calculation and data processing functions
* Fit-for-purpose apps built on top of Datagrok.

[See this example for cheminformatics](solutions/domains/chem/chem.md#chemically-aware-spreadsheet).

<summary>Example</summary>

For example, when you open a CSV file containing molecules in the SMILES format, the following happens:

* Data is parsed, and the semantic type `molecule` is assigned to the corresponding column.
* Molecules are automatically rendered in 2D in the spreadsheet.
* Column tooltip now shows the most diverse molecules in your dataset.
* Default column filter is now a sketcher-driven substructure search.
* A top menu item labeled **Chem** appears.
* Molecule-specific info panes, such as **Toxicity** or **Drug Likeness**, appear on the right.

## What makes it so fast?

Our goal is to let you explore at the speed of thought. To achieve this, we
designed Datagrok from scratch:

* **Data engine**: In-memory columnar database that runs on both server and web
  browser. Fast random access, efficient data storage, aggregation, compression,
  filtering, transformation, and caching.

* **Native viewers**: Access the data engine directly for maximum performance.
  They share statistics, cached calculations, and cooperate on tasks like
  filtering or selection.

* **App server**: Uses the data engine to exchange binary-optimized datasets
  with the client. Custom ORM to efficiently work with metadata in Postgres.

* **Compute engine**: Supports multiple languages working with
  binary-optimized datasets. Scales well. GPU acceleration of ML routines.
  Supports custom Docker containers.

and [performance optimization](../develop/under-the-hood/performance.md).
