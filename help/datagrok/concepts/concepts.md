These concepts are foundational in Datagrok:

### Platform

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dataframe" label="Dataframe" default>

A [Dataframe (or table)](table.md) is a fundamental data structure in Datagrok.
Dataframes are optimized for [exploratory data analysis](../solutions/domains/use-cases/eda.md) and support common data
operations like filtering, sorting, or aggregations.

Dataframes can be manipulated directly through the UI,
[Console](../navigation/panels/panels.md#console), or scripts that automate data transformations. Every change made to a dataframe is automatically
recorded, which means it can be audited and reproduced.

Dataframes are visualized using the [grid](../../visualize/viewers/grid.md) viewer.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="functions" label="Functions">

In Datagrok, everything is a [function](functions/functions.md), from simple
data manipulation, like deleting a column, to complex operations, like running
queries or scripts. 

Functions can be [annotated](functions/func-params-annotation.md), audited, and
linked. They can be written in any language and executed both on the server and
the browser. You can incorporate functions into larger scripts regardless of the
function's language, which lets you automate complex operations, [auto generate UI](../../compute/compute.md#autogenerated-ui), and [augment data](../../explore/data-augmentation/data-augmentation.md).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="entities" label="Entities">

Datagrok treats many different objects as [entities](objects.md). For example,
data connections, users, functions, or layouts are all _entities_. Information
about these entities, including their metadata, is stored in a centralized
database. All entities share a set of common operations, including sharing,
assigning privileges, and retrieving their URL. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### User interface

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="views" label="Views">

A [view](../navigation/views/views.md) is a window designed for specific tasks.
For example:

* Double-clicking a dataframe opens a [Table View](../navigation/views/table-view) resembling Excel
* Double-clicking a query opens the [Query Editor](../../access/databases/databases.md#query-editor)
* Clicking a **Browse icon** on the **Sidebar** opens [Browse](../navigation/views/browse.md) 

You can open the same object in multiple views and work on each independently.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="layouts" label="Layouts">

In Datagrok, the visual representation of tabular data (a
_[layout](../../visualize/view-layout.md)_) is separated from the data 
(the _dataframe_). This separation lets you do the following:

* Apply multiple layouts to the same table. This means you can customize views
  according to your needs without duplicating the underlying data.
* Save layouts and apply them to different projects and tables.
* Share layouts independently of the underlying data.
* Work on visual presentation separately from data manipulation.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Data management

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="projects" label="Projects">

Projects act like folders containing various _entities_ such as dataframes,
queries, or scripts. For example, [dashboards](project/dashboard.md) are projects that include the underlying data (a [dataframe](table.md)) and the visualizations applied to it (a [layout](../../visualize/view-layout.md)). 

Projects are essential for organizing, managing, and sharing data assets. The
[Browse](../navigation/views/browse.md) view organizes projects in a tree
that governs [entity privileges](../../govern/authorization.md).
