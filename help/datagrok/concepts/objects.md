Certain classes of objects in Datagrok have a common set of operations and features applicable to them. We call these
objects _entities_. Here they are:

* [Function](functions/functions.md)
* [Function Call](functions/function-call.md)
* Data Pipeline
* [Data Connection](../../access/access.md#data-connection)
* [Data Query](../../access/access.md#data-query)
* Data Job
* DB Table Info
* DB Column Info
* [User](../../govern/user.md)
* [Group](../../govern/group.md)
* [Model](../../learn/learn.md)
* [Notebook](../../compute/jupyter-notebook.md)
* [Package](../../develop/develop.md#packages)
* [Project](../../collaborate/project.md)
* Repository
* [Script](../../compute/scripting.md)
* [Table (dataframe)](table.md)
* [View Layout](../../visualize/view-layout.md)

The following operations can be applied to any entity:

* Getting its URL
* Referencing it in a [chat](../../collaborate/chat.md), in [markup](../navigation/markup.md), or in a [dashboard](../../visualize/dashboard.md)
* Assigning [privileges](../../govern/authorization.md), such as rights to view, edit, or share, to a particular instance
* Using it as a parameter in the [audit](../../govern/audit.md) record
* Deleting it

* [Privileges](../../govern/authorization.md)

* [Self-Learning platform](../../govern/catalog/self-learning-platform.md)
