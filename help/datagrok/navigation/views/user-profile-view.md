The **User Profile** view provides personal account settings and user-specific
information. It is not part of core navigation, but it's useful for managing
your credentials and access permissions and reviewing notifications or details
about any user on the platform.

When you open a user profile (your own or someone else's), the **Context Panel**
shows user-specific [info panes](../navigation.md#info-panes) that summarize identity,
permissions, and activity:
* **Personal**: Basic user information such as name, email, join date, and profile picture
* **Roles**: Roles assigned to the user
* **Member of**: Groups the user belongs to
* **Projects**: Projects the user has created or interacted with (subject to your permissions)
* **Activity**: A chronological log of recent actions performed by the user across the platform
* **Chats**: Chat threads the user participates in

To open your own profile, click your avatar on the **Sidebar** or go to **Browse > My Stuff** root level. 
To open someone else's user profile, navigate to **Browse > Platform > Users**
and double-click any user in the list.
