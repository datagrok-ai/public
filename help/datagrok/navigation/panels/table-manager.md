Table Manager, available via **View | Tables**, contains a list of currently open tables. Use it to navigate between
tables, select them, or perform batch actions. It also allows to view metadata on multiple tables in a tabular format.

The implementation is based on the [grid](../../../visualize/viewers/grid.md), so many of the grid's features apply.

Usage:

|                      |                |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Click                | Activate or create table view   |
| Shift+drag           | Select multiple tables |
| Ctrl+click           | Toggle table selection |
| Esc                  | Clear table selection |
| Right-click          | Show popup menu |
| Popup: Show \        | x | Toggle visibility of the property "x" |
| Popup: Open as table | Add tables to workspace (tables in rows) |

If a context menu is open when multiple columns are selected, user will be present with a choice to apply commands to
either current table, or all selected tables.
