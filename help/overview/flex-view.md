# Flex view

Use this view to reference data, viewers, summary statistics, and other things from disparate tables. 
This view is a good way to provide [project](project.md) summary. The content is stored
in the [markup](../features/markup.md) format (directly editable in the 
[properties panel](../features/property-panel.md) on the right). That allows to reference pretty much 
anything in the platform, including tables, [viewers](../visualize/viewers.md), columns, statistics, 
metadata, references to users, and invoking [functions](functions/function.md).

It's always possible to edit the markup directly, but we have made it even easier to reference relevant content.
[Drag-and-drop](../features/drag-and-drop.md) any entity into the view to reference it. The toolbox on the 
left provides quick links to add the following:
 
* Common
  * **Clear** - clears the markup
  * **Summarize** - adds a quick summary for the current project
  * **View links** - adds links to all views currently opened
* Viewers
  * Add viewers for the specified table 
* Statistics
  * Add statistics for the specified table 
* Table
  * **Table link** - adds a table link 
  * **Summarize** - adds table summary with columns in rows, and column tags as columns 
* Column  
  

* Add project-related content from the left pane
* Drag-and-drop objects such as tables or columns into this view
