# Entities

Certain classes of objects in Datagrok have a common set of operations and features applicable to
them. We call these objects _entities_. Here they are:

  * [Function](functions/function.md)
  * [Function Call](functions/function-call.md)
  * [Data Pipeline](../access/data-pipeline.md)
  * [Data Connection](../access/data-connection.md)
  * [Data Query](../access/data-query.md)
  * [Data Job](../access/data-job.md)
  * [DB Table Info](../access/db-table-info.md)
  * [DB Column Info](../access/db-column-info.md)
  * [User](../govern/user.md)
  * [Group](../govern/group.md)
  * [Model](../learn/predictive-modeling.md)
  * [Notebook](../develop/jupyter-notebook.md)
  * [Package](../develop/develop.md#packages)
  * [Project](project.md)
  * [Repository](../access/connectors/git.md)
  * [Script](../develop/scripting.md)
  * [Table](table.md)
  * [View Layout](../visualize/view-layout.md)

The following operations can be applied to any entity:

  * Getting its URL
  * Referencing it in a [chat](../collaborate/chat.md), in [markup](markup.md), or in a [dashboard](dashboard.md)
  * Assigning [privileges](../govern/authorization.md), such as rights to view, edit, or share, to a particular instance
  * Using it as a parameter in the [audit](../govern/audit.md) record
  * Deleting it
