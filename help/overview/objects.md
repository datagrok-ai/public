# Entities

Certain classes of objects in Grok have a similar set of operations and features applicable to
them. We call these objects 'entities'. Here they are:

* [Function](functions/function.md)
* [Function Call](functions/function-call.md)
* [Data Pipeline](../access/data-pipeline.md)
* [Data Source](../access/data-source.md)
* [Data Connection](../access/data-connection.md)
* [Data Query](../access/data-query.md)
* [Data Job](../access/data-job.md)
* [DB Table Info](../access/db-table-info.md)
* [DB Column Info](../access/db-column-info.md)
* [User](../govern/user.md)
* [Group](../govern/group.md)
* [Script](../compute/scripting.md)
* [Project](project.md)
* [Table](table.md)
* [View Layout](../visualize/view-layout.md)

The following operations can be applied to any entity:

* Getting its URL
* Referencing it in a [chat](../collaborate/chat.md), in markup or in the [dashboard]
* Assigning [privileges](../govern/security.md#privileges) to a particular instance
* Using it as a parameter in the [audit](../govern/audit.md) record
* Deleting it
