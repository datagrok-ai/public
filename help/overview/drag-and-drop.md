# Drag-and-Drop

Datagrok lets almost all objects be drag-and-dropped, which makes a lot of interactions more intuitive.
As soon as a user starts dragging an object, all possible drop zones get highlighed.

Here are some of commonly used drag-and drop operations:

* [Variables view](navigation.md#variables)
* Columns 
  * Rearrange grid column order (drag by the grid column header)
  * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog
  * Drag into [Add New Column](../transform/add-new-column.md) dialog

## Drag-and-Dropping Columns

Drag-and-dropping columns is an intuitive way to choose columns on viewers, or perform operations on
them. A number of controls can be used as a source of drag-and-drop: 
[Grid](../visualize/viewers/grid.md), [Column Manager](../explore/column-manager.md), [Table Manager](../overview/table-manager.md)  
Most of the viewers, and a lot of dialogs accept columns that are being dragged.
