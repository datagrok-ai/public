title: "User group"
---

Datagrok has a flexible mechanism for grouping users together:
![Group members and memberships](img/groups.gif "Group members and memberships")

A user can belong to more than one group. A group can be included in another group, which is useful for both reflecting
organization hierarchy and implementing role-based security.

Example: **User 1** is member of **Group 1**. **User 2** and **User 3** are also members of **Group 1**, because they're
members of **Group 2**, which have membership in **Group 1**:

![Group members and memberships](../img/groups.png)

In addition to that, there are some actions that are applicable to user groups:

* Chat with the group of user
* Request membership
* Share entities

## Group admin

Within a group, one or more members can be assigned as admins. This means they can:

* add / remove members
* approve / deny membership requests
* edit group name

If user is the only admin in group, he / she can't leave group or revoke his / her admin privileges.

## Requesting a membership

To request a membership, right-click on a group and choose "Request membership". A request will be sent
to [group admin](group.md#group-admin). Once it is approved or declined, a notification will appear in the
[notification panel](user.md#profile). [Audit record](aud../audit/audit.mds created for both request and a resolution.

## Granting membership via URL

Datagrok supports granting membership via URL. You can invite unlimited users
outside the Datagrok instance to join a particular group. You can also apply
this functionality to track a cohort of users who access the platform via a
specific link, for example, after watching a demo.

### Create an invitation link

1. Go to **Manage** > **Groups**.
1. Right-click the group and select **Edit…**. A dialog opens.
1. To generate a password, click the button next to the **Password** field. The
   dialog displays an autogenerated _password_.
1. Copy the _password_ and use it to create an invitation link as follows:

   `<instance URL>?groupPassword=<password>`

   For example:

   `public.datagrok.ai/?groupPassword=w0TDE6RcpH8XO0ZIBSauVLos`

 >Note: Only the group administrator can create an invitation link.

## Groups and roles

Authorization system is based on user groups and roles. There are one group called "All users", that contains all users by default
and unlimited quantity of other groups:
![group all users](../img/group-all-users.png)
All groups can be a member of any other group, but circular membership is forbidden. Each user has a personal security
group, which called by the name of the user, so it can be added to any other security group.

A [user group](group.md) might have a number of rules associated with it. A rule applies to all members of the group and
grants a privilege to a list of [entities](../../datagrok/concepts/objects.md) of the specified type that pass a
[specified filter](#defining-entities-for-a-rule). You can think of a group with defined privileges as a 'role'.

Although, there are classic roles if you want to separate defined privileges.

Roles can be assigned to either users or groups.
Each role includes a “Can assign” option. When this option is enabled, the selected user or group is granted the ability to assign that role to other users or groups.

## Defining entities for a rule

There are three ways to define entities for a rule (filters 1 and 2 can be combined):

1. specified entity
2. entities marked with a specified tag
3. entities of the specified type

## Favorites 

Drag-and-drop app to group favorites, and it will appear on sidebar at the startup for all group users.

## Examples

This system lets us easily setup access rights for groups of people and subsets of entities. Here are some examples:

* Let David edit the 'demographics' dataset
* Create role 'Chemists' (a group with rules but no members)

* Let Chemists view any entities marked with the 'chemistry' tag
* Let Chemists execute queries marked with the 'chemistry' tag

## Filtering

You can use these fields to filter groups with smart search:

| Field       | Description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|

| name        |                                                    |
