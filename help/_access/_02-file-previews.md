# File previews

The file exploration view can not only work with tabular data, but also supports custom visualizers
for file types, and also a number of different processors. For instance, if we select and R file, we
can see that not only the text of that file is previewed, but also that the contents of the file are
color-coded. If we select an image, we'll also see its preview.

As for text files, it is also possible to edit them.

In general, it is possible to provide an external viewer or editor to any file.
