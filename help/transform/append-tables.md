title: "Append tables"

Append the content of two tables.

First, select two tables to append in the Table Manager. Right-click and navigate to `2 tables > Append`.  A result table will be created containing the common columns and associated data.

Once comparison is done, use the color-coded interactive spreadsheet to identify values, rows, and columns that were
added, removed, and changed.
