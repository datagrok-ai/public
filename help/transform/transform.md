title: "Data wrangling"
---

_Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data cleaning, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "
raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of
downstream purposes such as analytics._

All of the data manipulation routines can be recorded, saved as macros, and applied to a new dataset. Here are some of
the commonly used routines:

* [Add New Column](add-new-column.md)
* [Anonymize Data](anonymize-data.md)
* [Append Tables](append-tables.md)
* [Categorize Data](categorize-data.md)
* [Batch Data Editor](batch-edit.md)
* [Change Type](change-column-type.md)
* [Aggregate Rows](aggregate-rows.md)
* [Compare Tables](compare-tables.md)
* [Extract regular expression](extract-regexp.md)
* [Filter to Column](filter-to-column.md)
* [Join Tables](join-tables.md)
* [Impute Missing Values](../explore/missing-values-imputation.md)
* [Select Duplicates](select-duplicates.md)
* [Select Missing Values](select-missing-values.md)
* [Select Random Rows](select-random-rows.md)
* [Text to Columns](text-to-columns.md)
