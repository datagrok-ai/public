# Recipe Editor

Recipe editor lets you define data transformations. A Recipe can be used as a post-run steps for data
queries.

## Recipe structure

A recipe consists of a number of parameterized steps. There are different ways to add steps:

### Modify data as you normally would

Use the regular tools for modifying the data, mostly located under Edit, Select, and Data top menus.
