Datagrok can connect to most relational databases 
([30+ databases supported](connectors/connectors.md)), enabling you to do the following:

* Browse databases schemas, tables, and columns.
* Create and edit queries visually.
* Query databases using parameterized queries.
* Use query as a dynamically refreshed data source for dashboards.
* Share connections and queries with others.
* Configure user privileges.
* Create data pipelines.

:::note Developers

You can [create custom connectors](create-custom-connectors.md). 
You can also [connect to a data source, query data, and share connections programmatically](../../develop/how-to/access-data.md#connections).

:::

## Connecting to database

### Adding connection

![Add a new database connection](img/database-connection.gif)

To add a new connection, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Data > Databases**.
2. In the **Database Manager**, right-click the desired connector and select
   **Add connectionâ€¦** to open the **Add new connection** dialog.
3. Fill in the connection parameters.
4. Click **TEST** to test the connection, then click **OK** to save it. If the
 connection fails, verify your connection details and that you added Datagrok's IP addresses to your allowlist.

:::note

Ensure your database is accessible from the Datagrok server, as the connection originates from there.

:::

Some connection parameters have unique characteristics, and it's important to specify them correctly:

* _JDBC connection_. For connections that support JDBC, you can use the `Conn.
  string` parameter to enter a custom JDBC connection string. Leave all other
  parameter fields empty. You still need to enter credentials.
* _Credentials_. You have two ways to specify credentials:
  * Manually. When entered manually, Datagrok stores secrets in a [secure privilege management system](../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#credentials-management-system). To specify who can change the connection credentials, click the **Gear** icon
   and select from the **Credential owner** dropdown.

  * Use the [Secrets Manager](../../govern/access-control/data-connection-credentials.md), such as the AWS Secrets Manager.

Upon successful connection, the database appears in the [Database Manager](https://public.datagrok.ai/connect) 
under the respective data source.
By expanding the database, you can view its saved queries. [If connectors support it](connectors/connectors.md), you can also inspect the schemas,
tables, and columns of relational databases.

:::note

Like other objects in Datagrok, newly created connections are only visible to
the user who created them. To let others access the connection, you must share
it (right-click the connection and select **Share...** from the list of
options).

:::

### Caching data

You can cache query results to improve query performance. To learn more, see
[Caching function results](../../develop/how-to/function_results_cache.md)

### Modifying connection

To modify a connection, right-click it and select **Edit...** from the list of
options. To quickly create a connection similar to an existing one, right-click
it and select **Clone...**

## Database Manager

**Database Manager** lets you brows database schemas and other
objects, such as queries, tables, and table columns (if supported by
the providers). You can perform various operations like adding new connections
and queries, previewing data, running queries, and managing objects using
context actions that are accessible through right-clicking an object. If you
don't see a certain action, it may be due to insufficient permissions. Contact
your Datagrok administrator for assistance.

The **Context Panel**, which is located to the right of the **Database
Manager**, helps you work with database objects. Whenever you click an object
within the **Database Manager**, the **Context Panel** displays the object's
properties and context actions. For example, when you click a table, the
**Context Panel** lets you view the table's metadata, dynamically preview the
table's contents, run queries, and access other relevant information and
options. To learn more about the **Context Panel**, see 
[Context Panel](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/panels.md#context-panel).

:::note developers

**Context Panel** can be extended. You can add custom [info panes](../../develop/how-to/add-info-panel.md)
 and [context actions](../../develop/how-to/context-actions.md).

:::

![DB Hierarchy Browser](img/db-hierarchy-browser.gif)

### Schema Browser

The **Schema Browser** helps you explore all tables and columns belonging to a
connection. To open a **Schema Browser**, in the **Database Manager**
right-click a connection and select **Browse schema**.

Similar to the **Database Manager**, clicking an object in the **Schema
Browser** updates the **Context Panel** with object-specific properties and
actions. To open the object's context menu, right-click it.

![Schema browser](img/browse-schema.gif)

### Viewing schema as dataframe

Another way to explore a database schema is through an 
[interactive spreadsheet](../../visualize/viewers/grid.md). To access this feature, in the
**Database Manager**, right-click a connection and select **Open schema as
table**.

## Working with queries

Datagrok provides several tools for creating, exploring, and editing queries.

* _Editors_:
  * [Query Editor](#query-editor) is the main interface for executing database
    queries. Using this tool, you can write and edit statements in SQL and other
    languages and use functions to add post-processing steps.
  * [Aggregation Editor](#aggregation-editor) can be used for manipulating,
    summarizing, filtering, and pivoting table data.
* _Built-in queries for tables_:
  * **Get All**: retrieves all table data. Use it with caution.
  * **Get TOP 100**: retrieves the first 100 rows.

  :::tip

  To retrieve specific columns, hold down the Shift key on your keyboard while
  clicking the desired columns in the schema. Once selected, right-click the
  selection and run **Get All** or **Get TOP 100** just for these columns.

  :::

* [_Join tables_](#join-tables): This tool lets you merge multiple tables within
  a database connection.

:::note

  The ability to query tables is connector-specific and may not be available for all.

:::

When you successfully create a query, it appears in the **Database Manager**
under the corresponding connection or table. From there, you can run it, share
it with others, manage access, and perform other tasks.

:::tip

To see all queries belonging to a connection, right-click it and select **Browse
queries** from the list of options.

:::

### Query Editor

**Query Editor** is the main interface for executing database queries. To open
it, right-click a database connection or a table and select **Add query** (for
connections) or **New SQL Query...** (for tables).

The **Query Editor** has two tabs:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="query" label="Query" default>

This tab is where you write and edit queries. As you work on your query, you can
preview the query output at any time by clicking the **Run/Refresh** button on
the menu ribbon or by pressing the F5 key on the keyboard. The query result is
displayed in the bottom part of the editor as an interactive dataframe. In the
dataframe, you can view object details, perform actions on columns, and more.

When your query is complete, give it a name and click the **Save** button. If
you don't want to save the query, close the editor without saving.

![Create a database query](img/query-add.gif)

:::note

You can also add the query results to the workspace for further analysis. To do
so, click the **Dropdown Arrow** control in the bottom left corner of the
**Query** tab and select **Add results to workspace**.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="transformations" label="Transformations">

Use this tab to apply post-processing operations to your query:

![Query transformations](img/transformations.gif)

1. Select a function to apply to a query. Use checkboxes next to the operation categories to filter.
1. Set the function parameters in the dialog that opens.
1. Click **OK**.
1. Repeat the steps as needed.

Each transformation is recorded. To see the results of each record, locate the
record on the left and click it. The data output for this step is displayed in
the **Preview** section.

You can also edit or remove transformation records as needed. To edit a
transformation step, click the **Dropdown Arrow** control next to the
transformation record and select from the list of options. To remove the
transformation record entirely, click the **Delete** (**x**) icon.

:::tip

Use the menu ribbon on top to add or remove columns quickly.

:::

:::note Developers

You can create custom transformation functions in R, Python, or any other
language. See [Scripting](../../compute/scripting/scripting.mdx).

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Aggregation Editor

**Aggregation Editor** is a visual tool for summarizing and pivoting table data.
To open it, right-click a table in the **Database Manager** and select
**Aggregate data**.

The **Aggregation Editor** has two tabs: **Queries** and **Transformations**.
The **Transformations** tab works similarly to the [Query Editor](#query-editor)'s
 tab and lets you add post-processing steps.

To aggregate data, use the **Query** tab. Here, you can choose which columns to
include in your report and decide how to pivot and group them. You can show one
or multiple aggregated values for rows, for example, average sales and headcount
by country. Additionally, you can pivot rows into columns to show one or more
aggregated values for each column. You can also perform both actions to produce
a pivot table that shows an aggregated value for every intersection of rows and
columns.

* **Group by**: Use this field to specify columns to be used for grouping rows.
  To do so, click the **Add** (**+**) icon and select the desired column from
  the list. The chosen column then acts as a key, with its unique values serving
  as row identifiers. You can add multiple columns.
* **Pivot**: Use this field to specify the rows that you want to show as
  columns. To do so, click the **Add** (**+**) icon and select the desired
  column from the list. You can pivot one or more columns.
* **Aggregate**: Use this field to add aggregated values. First, click the
  **Add** (**+**) icon and select the column you want to aggregate. Datagrok
  automatically applies a default aggregating function based on the data type:
  _average_ for numerical data and _count_ for categorical data. To change the
  aggregating function, right-click the column, select **Aggregation**, and
  choose your preferred function from the list. Each column can only have one
  aggregating function, but you can add multiple columns or the same column with
  different aggregating functions.

  :::note

  If you add columns only to the **Aggregation** field without adding any
  columns to the **Group by** or **Pivot** fields, the resulting query returns a
  single row that shows the total aggregate values for each column added in the
  **Aggregation** field.

  :::

* **Filter**: Use this field to filter the results using the pattern syntax. To
  do so, click the **Add** (**+**) icon, select the column to which you want to
  apply the filter, then set the condition (see [parameter patterns](#parameterized-queries) for syntax).

![Aggregation query](img/aggr-query.gif)

As you work on your query, you can preview the query output as an interactive
dataframe. In the dataframe, you can view object details, perform actions on
columns, and more. When your query is complete, give it a name and click the
**Save** button. If you don't want to save the query, close the editor without
saving.

### Join tables

Use this tool to merge tables:

  1. Right-click a table and select **Join tables**. This action opens a dialog
     with a list of columns connected by keys.
  1. Select the checkboxes that correspond to the columns you want to include.
     Based on your selections, Datagrok automatically generates an SQL statement
     and a preview of the results. If desired, you can manually modify the SQL
     statement. The preview will update accordingly as you make changes.
  1. When finished, use the **Dropdown Arrow** control in the bottom left corner
     of the dialog to choose between the two options:
     * **Save as query**: This opens the **Query Editor** where you can further
       edit the query.
     * **Add result to workspace**: This opens the query output as a dataframe
       for detailed exloration.

![Create a join query](img/query-builder.gif)

### Parameterized queries

In Datagrok, queries are functions. Like with JavaScript functions, you can add
metadata to a Datagrok function at the function level or the parameter level.
This metadata can include things like the function's name, connection details,
caching options, and more. At the parameter level, you can specify metadata such
as the parameter's name as it should appear in the user interface, its semantic
type, input type, and so on. To define query parameters, use SQL/Sparql comments
in the query header : `--` for SQL, and `#` for Sparql. The syntax for defining
query parameters is based on
[scripting](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation), with
additions specific to queries.

When you want a query to ask for input every time you run it, you can create a
_parameterized query_. This type of query relies on one or more parameters,
which are placeholders for input values. When you run a parameterized query,
Datagrok autogenerates a parameter dialog, prompting you to enter the relevant
parameter values. By doing so, you can use the same query to retrieve data that
matches different criteria.

#### Query parameters

The syntax for defining query parameters is based on 
[functions syntax](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md) with
additions specific to queries.

Queries have a special `connection` parameter corresponding to the query
connection name. It is optional, just like the rest of parameters.

Another addition is the `list<T>` parameter type. It denotes a list of objects
of type `T`. Currently only strings are supported. You can add an input/output
of type `list<string>`.

#### Add a parameter

1. Right-click a query and select **Edit**. A **Query View** opens.

2. In the **Query** tab, annotate parameters in the box provided using
   SQL/Sparql comments. Use `--` for SQL and `#` for Sparql.
   > Example:
   >
   >```sql
   >--input: string productName
   >select * from products where productname = @productName
   >```

3. Click **Save**.

#### Input parameters

To define input parameters for your SQL query, use the `--input` annotation
followed by the parameter's data type, name, default value, and any additional
options. You can also include a brief description of the parameter that will
appear in the UI:

`--input: <type> <name> = <initialValue> {<option>: <value>; ...} [<description>]`

Supported parameter types include `integer`, `double`, `boolean`, `string`,
`DateTime`, and `list<T>` (a list of parameter type `T`, currently supports the
`strings` type only). [Additional options](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation) are
based on the parameter type, and may include _choices_, _suggestions_, and
_validators_.

For example, this is an optional string parameter "shipCountry" with the initial value "France"
(learn more about [initial values and optional parameters](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md#initial-values-and-optional-parameters)):

```
--input: string shipCountry = "France" { nullable: true }
SELECT * FROM customers where shipCountry = @country
```

You can also use lists to pass multiple values for a single parameter. For
example, you can use lists to retrieve data for a specific set of users or
analyze sales data for a particular country. To use lists in queries, you can
specify `list<T>` as the parameter's data type and wrap its use inside the SQL
query into `= ANY(p)`, or a similar operator with an alternative selection of
the comparison type, such as `>= ANY` or `< ANY`. Here's an example:

```
--input: list<string> shipCountry = ['France', 'Italy', 'Germany']
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE shipCountry = ANY(@shipCountry)
```

This query returns all records from the `Orders` table where the `shipCountry`
column matches any of the values in the `shipCountry` list.

To help you use queries more quickly and accurately, use _choices_,
_suggestions_, and _validators_. _Choices_ allow users to select from a
predefined list of values for a given parameter, _suggestions_ provide users
with auto-complete suggestions based on what they type in the input field, and
query _validators_ validate the query without executing it.

You can define _choices_ using a comma-separated list of values, a name of
another query, or by writing an actual SQL query. Here's an example of how to
define _choices_ for a _ship country_ input parameter using all three methods:

```sql
--input: string shipCountry = "France" {choices: ['France', 'Italy', 'Germany']}
--input: string shipCountry = "France" {choices: Demo:northwind:countries}
--input: string shipCountry = "France" {choices: Query("SELECT DISTINCT shipCountry FROM Orders")}
```

:::tip

Parameter's choices, validators, and suggestions can depend on the value of
another parameter. This is useful when creating queries with hierarchical
choices, where each subsequent parameter depends on the previous one. To do
this, specify the input parameter you want to reuse and its default value, if
applicable. Then, define the choices query using the `Query()` function and
reference the input parameter using the `@` symbol.

<details>
<summary>Here's an example</summary>

```sql
--input: string state = "NY" {choices: Query("SELECT DISTINCT state FROM public.starbucks_us")}
--input: string city = "Albany" {choices: Query("SELECT DISTINCT city FROM public.starbucks_us WHERE state = @state")}
SELECT * FROM public.starbucks_us WHERE (city = @city)
```

Here, the `state` and `city` parameters are defined as strings with default
values. The `city` parameter's choices query references the `state` parameter
using `@state`. This ensures that the choices are filtered based on the value of
`state`.

</details>

:::

To define _suggestions_ or _validators_, provide the name of the function that
will be executed to generate suggestions or validators as the user types a
value.

A special query input type is a 
[filter pattern](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/func-params-annotation.md) that
allows you to enter free-text conditions like "this week" for dates, or ">50"
for numbers.

#### Output parameters

Output parameters define how the query output is presented. By default, a
query's result is returned as a dataframe. You can specify a different data type
in the output parameter. The following types are supported: `int`, `float`,
`string`, `bool`, `map`. Here's an example from the
[Chembl](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chembl)
package, where the query returns a string of the semantic type `Molecule`:

```sql
--output: string smiles {semType: Molecule}
```

## Running queries

To run a query, locate the query in the **Database Manager** and double-click
it. For parameterized queries, Datagrok automatically generates a parameter
dialog that prompts you to enter values for the input parameters. The input
parameters are then substituted for inputs from the UI controls, allowing you to
create complex queries with dynamic choices that are easy to use and maintain.

Here's an example of a parameterized query with several input parameters and
_options_:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="param-query" label="Parameterized query" default>

```sql
--input: int employeeId = 5
--input: string shipVia = "=3" {pattern: int}
--input: double freight = 10.0
--input: string shipCountry = "France" {choices: Query("SELECT DISTINCT shipCountry FROM Orders")}
--input: string shipCity = "starts with r" {pattern: string}
--input: bool freightLess1000 = true
--input: datetime requiredDate = "1/1/1995"
--input: string orderDate = "after 1/1/1995" {pattern: datetime}
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE (employeeId = @employeeId)
    AND (freight >= @freight)
    AND @shipVia(shipVia)
    AND ((freight < 1000) OR NOT @freightLess1000)
    AND (shipCountry = @shipCountry)
    AND @shipCity(shipCity)
    AND @orderDate(orderDate)
    AND (requiredDate >= @requiredDate)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="parameter-dialog" label="Parameter dialog">

![Parametrized queries](img/parameterized-queries.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note developers

To run a query programmatically, see this 
[code snippet](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/data-access/parameterized-query).
Learn how to [expose the parameter dialog to end-users as an application](../../develop/how-to/create-package.md).
<!--Mention?: when the
cartridge is not deployed on that particular database, the query returns an
error-->

:::

After running a query, you typically get back a dataframe. You can perform
various operations on this dataframe, such as data cleansing, transformation,
[and more](../../visualize/viewers/grid.md). All of these actions get recorded
as macros, and will be replayed when the query is re-executed. Once you have the
data set up to your satisfaction, you can add viewers and create a
visualization.

To view the queries you've created or those shared with you, you can use the
**Queries Gallery** (**Data** > **Queries**). This gallery provides a convenient
interface to quickly access and manage queries. You can search queries by their
name or tag and use the **Context Panel** to view information and actions for
the selected query.

## Creating dynamic dashboards for query results

You can create and publish dashboards that query data from a database and then
present it in a visual layout. For parameterized queries, these dashboards can
be dynamic, allowing dashboard users to change the query parameters right inside
the dashboard to refine search criteria and interact with data in real-time.

To save the query output as a dynamic dashboard, do the following:

1. Run a query to open a dataframe and create a desired view of the query output.
1. On the **Sidebar**, click **Projects** > **Upload**.
1. In the **Upload project** dialog, enter a name and description (optional) in
   the fields provided.
1. Select how to store data:
    * Save the data as a static snapshot.
    * Store the data as a generation script by toggling the **Data sync**
      control. The query re-executes each time the project is opened. To learn
      more about dynamic data updates in projects, see [Dynamic data](../../datagrok/navigation/basic-tasks/basic-tasks.md#dynamic-data).
1. Click **OK** to upload the project.
1. [Share](#sharing-query-results) the project with others.

![Dynamic dashboards](img/dynamic-dashboards.gif)

## Sharing query results

You have two options to share query results in Datagrok:

* Share its URL
* Share it as a project.

Each query output has a unique URL, which has all the information needed to
recreate the query, including its parameters. This is especially useful for
parameterized queries, where you can embed the query output on external websites
with specific parameters applied. After you have executed a query, copy the URL
from the address bar and share it with others. When this URL is accessed, a
query gets re-executed, so the query output always displays the latest data.
When the users open the report, they can still change the query parameters in
the **Toolbox** on the left.

:::note

To access the query results from the link provided, users must have the
necessary permissions to execute this query.

:::

If you want to persist a specific layout, create a dynamic dashboard, or assign
access permissions to specific groups or users, you can share query results as a
project. First, you need to [upload the project](#creating-dynamic-dashboards-for-query-results).
 Then, locate the desired project in **Data** > **Projects** and right-click it to share. Users
will get an email notification with the access link. To learn more about access
privileges, see [Access control](#access-control).

## Access control

In Datagrok, certain objects called _entities_ have a
 [set of operations](../../datagrok/concepts/objects.md) that can be applied to them. 
 These entities are connections, queries, tables, and table columns, all of which can
  be shared, assigned permissions, annotated, and more.

When you create an entity such as a connection or a query, it's private and
visible to you only. To make it accessible to others, you can share it.

To share:

1. Right-click the connection or a query you want to share and select **Share...**.
2. In the **Share** dialog, enter a user or a group that needs access and set
   corresponding permissions. These privileges can be given to users or to
   [groups](../../govern/access-control/users-and-groups#groups). For more information on the access privilege
   model, see [Permissions](../../govern/access-control/access-control.md#permissions).
3. Optional. Add a description in the provided text field. If you don't want to
   notify the recipients, clear the **Send notification** checkbox. :::note

   If you enter the name of a user or a group, they are notified through the
   Datagrok interface. To share an object with a user who doesn't have a
   Datagrok account, enter their email address. They will receive an email
   notification containing a link to the shared object and the entered
   description. After they sign up for a Datagrok account, they will be able to
   access the shared object.

   :::

4. Click **OK** to share.

![Share a database connection](img/sharing-database-connections.gif)

If you can't share a connection or a query, you may have insufficient
permissions. Contact your Datagrok administrator for assistance.

:::tip

Use the **Context Pane** on the right to inspect and quickly adjust access
permissions to your databases, manage queries, view history and activity
details, send comments to those you're sharing with, and more.

:::

:::caution important

Datagrok query belongs to the database connection for which it's created. It
means you can't share a query without sharing a connection. Deleting a
connection also deletes a query.

<!--

## Debugging queries

Debugging queries helps you fix and improve query performance.

For existing queries:

1. Right-click your query and select **Debug**. A dialog opens.
1. In the dialog, set parameters:
   * **Fetch size**: This parameter tells the JDBC driver how many rows to fetch from the
     database at one time. If set to zero, the driver chooses the optimal fetch
      size. The default limit for WebSocket messages is set to 10 MB.
             
      To obtain consistent fetch size.
      To persist the fetch size, include a meta parameter in your query:
        
        ```
        --meta.connectFetchSize: 10000
        SELECT * FROM very_big_table
        ```
        Or, to specify in megabytes:

        ```
        --meta.connectFetchSize: 10 MB
        ```
      
   * **Init fetch size** (optional): This parameter is the same as **Fetch
   size** but it applies to a [statement
   object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html).
   To persist this parameter, include a meta parameter in your query:

      ```
     --meta.initConnectFetchSize: 1000
     SELECT * FROM very_big_table
    ```

   * **Optimize fetch size**: Selecting this checkbox disables manual fetch size inputs
     and automatically tests different fetch sizes to determine the most
     efficient one for your query.
1. Press **OK**. A table with the fetch results opens.

:::note

You can debug queries in [Query Editor](#query-editor) by clicking on the "bug"
icon on top of the editor. Also, you can start debugging from the **Context
Panel** using the **Debug** section.

:::

When you finish debugging with **Optimize fetch size** off, you will see the
execution results, **Summary**, and detailed logs. **Summary** shows the times
of different stages of query execution. These metrics help you evaluate how
factors like network speed, data complexity, etc. affect performance.
**Summary** also explains what each metric means.

:::note

The network connection or the local disk load can affect the result a lot. For
better evaluation, run **Debug** several times in a row.

:::

You can always return to **Summary** and detailed logs to analyze them later. In order to do this:

1. Navigate to the desired saved query and expand the tree with historical runs.
2. Click on the run and open **Context Panel**.
3. Expand **Log** section. **Summary** and detailed logs are hidden under the appropriate subsection.

:::note

**Summary** and detailed logs are only available for queries that were run in Debug mode.

:::

To set a constant value for **Fetch size** and **Init fetch size** after
analyzing **Summary** or **Optimize fetch size** results, follow these steps:

1. Open the saved query in [Query Editor](#query-editor).
1. Add the meta parameters *initConnectFetchSize* or *connectFetchSize* with the
   desired value to the query declaration.
1. Save query.

For example:

```
--meta.connectFetchSize: 10 MB
--meta.initConnectFetchSize: 1000
SELECT * FROM data;
```
