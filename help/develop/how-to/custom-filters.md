title: "Develop custom filters"
---

Developers can extend Datagrok with custom filters. This could be done by defining a class that extends
[DG.Filter](http://datagrok.ai/js-api/dg/classes/Filter) class. An
[example](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Widgets/src/filters/radio-button-filter.ts) of such
class can be found in the [Widgets](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Widgets) package.

The filter then must be registered in the `package.js` file:

```js
//name: Single Choice
//description: A filter that lets you select exactly one category
//tags: filter
//output: filter result
export function radioButtonFilter() {
  return new RadioButtonFilter();
}

```

:::tip

If you are on version `^4.12.x` of `datagrok-tools`, you can use class decorators to register filters:

```ts
@grok.decorators.filter({
  semType: 'Country',
})
export class RadioButtonFilter extends DG.Filter {
  /* RadioButtonFilter contents */
}
```

This is equivalent to adding a function to `package.ts`. There is no need to add anything other than the class itself.
When you run the `build` script for your package, the webpack plugin called `FuncGeneratorPlugin` will add a special
`package.g.ts` file to your project. Note that it is not on the ignore list, so you are supposed to commit this file.

:::

The filter then can be invoked in the package with JS API as shown in
[custom filters example](https://dev.datagrok.ai/js/samples/ui/viewers/filters/custom-filters):

```js
let tv = grok.shell.addTableView(grok.data.demo.demog());
tv.filters({filters: [
  {type: 'Widgets:radioButtonFilter', columnName: 'race'},
]});

```

Or, alternatively, the filter can be added through UI:
