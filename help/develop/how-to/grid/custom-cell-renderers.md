title: "Develop custom cell renderers"
---

Datagrok provides an opportunity to use custom visualization for cells in data
[grid/table](../../../visualize/viewers/grid.md). This could be done by defining a function annotated with special
comments. It should take no args, return an instance of class derived from DG.GridCellRenderer, and have at least
two tags: `cellRenderer` and `cellRenderer-<type>` (specify the cell type here). This is it!

The following example defines a cell renderer for summary column visualized as bar chart. This is real code from the
["PowerGrid" public package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/PowerGrid/src/package.ts).

```typescript
//name: piechartCellRender
//tags: cellRenderer
//meta.cellType: piechart
//meta.virtual: true
//output: grid_cell_renderer result
export function piechartCellRenderer() {
  return new PieChartCellRenderer();
}
```

:::tip

If you are on version `^4.12.x` of `datagrok-tools`, you can use class decorators to register cell renderers:

```ts
@grok.decorators.cellRenderer({
  cellType: 'piechart',
  virtual: true,
})
export class PieChartCellRenderer extends DG.GridCellRenderer {
  /* PieChartCellRenderer contents */
}
```

This is equivalent to adding a function to `package.ts`. There is no need to add anything other than the class itself.
When you run the `build` script for your package, the webpack plugin called `FuncGeneratorPlugin` will add a special
`package.g.ts` file to your project. Note that it is not on the ignore list, so you are supposed to commit this file.

:::

Renderer class derived from `DG.GridCellRender` must implement `name` and `cellType` properties, the main drawing
method `render`, and optional `renderSettings` methods allowing to build UI HTML Element for renderer settings.
An example is
available ["PowerGrid" public package](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/PowerGrid/src/sparklines/piechart.ts)
.

Once a package containing that function is published, the platform will automatically create the corresponding
renderer when user creates a summary column of specified type. Here is how it looks:
