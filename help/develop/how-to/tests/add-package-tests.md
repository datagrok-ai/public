title: "Add package tests"
---

Packages developed for the platform should be tested. Datagrok supports several
mechanisms for testing purposes. This article provides instructions for
utilizing these mechanisms in the package code.

## Adding unit tests

We use a custom test framework that is similar to `Jest`, and it supports
Datagrok API. To learn more about that, see our [guide for packages](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/GUIDE.MD#tests).

To add tests for local testing, run the following command:

```shell
grok create <package-name> --test
```

If you need to add tests support to an existing package, run this command
instead:

```shell
cd <package-name>
grok add tests
```

Once you get package dependencies (`npm install`), you can start writing tests.
First, create a folder for your test files:

```shell
cd <package-name>/src
mkdir tests
```

Each file typically includes tests for one category. Here is an example:

```js
import { category, expect, test } from '@datagrok-libraries/utils/src/test';


category('Examples', () => {
  test('Success', async () => {
    expect(1, 1);
  });

  test('Fail', () => {
    throw 'Exception';
  });
});
```

Next, make sure to import your test files in `src/package-test.ts`. After that,
build and publish your package. There are several options to runs the tests:
[locally using datagrok-tools](test-packages.md#local-testing), via [DG console](test-packages.md#running-tests-in-the-platform-console), and via [Test manager](test-packages.md#test-manager). All public packages in the
[repository](../../../collaborate/public-repository.md) are tested using GitHub
Actions on every commit. There is an option to trigger GitHub Actions
[manually](test-packages.md#trigger-github-actions-manually), if something goes
wrong during the auto-check.

For some real-life examples, please refer to the
[Chem](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/tree/master/packages/Chem) package,
which has everything properly configured and all tests written properly.

## Skipping tests

If a test fails for some reason, you can skip it using the skipReason parameter
(specify a reason for skipping the test, for example,
the associated Jira issue key or GitHub issue number):

```js
test('Skipped', async () => {
  expect(1, 11);
}, {skipReason: 'GROK-99999'});
```

## Testing functions

Every package utilizes the concept of [functions](../../../datagrok/concepts/functions/functions.md).
Tests cases can be added directly to a function's annotation. Afterwards, the metadata
is used to test package functions automatically. Use the `test` parameter to add
test cases. A test is essentially any [grok script](../../under-the-hood/grok-script.md)
expression that will be evaluated to a boolean value. Here are some examples:

```ts
//name: square
//input: int x
//output: int y
//test: square(1) == 1
//test: square(2) == 4
//test: square(3) == 9
export function square(x: number): number {
  return x ** 2;
}
```

Functions with the following input/output parameter types can be tested using
the `test` annotation:

| Parameter type | Support | Input/output example                                                                                                         |

| string         | &check; | `test: f("a") == "b"` (use `""` for strings)                                                                                 |

| column_list    | *       | Requires a dataframe parameter<br />`f(getDataframe(), ["colname1", "colname2"])`                                            |
