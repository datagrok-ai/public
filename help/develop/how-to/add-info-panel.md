title: "Add an info panel"
---

[Info panels](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/info-panels.md) are a powerful tool for bringing
new context-specific data to the sight. You can inform users about an object
they see through these panels, which is why they have such a name. New details
typically appear along with the rest of the information in the [context panel](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/panels.md#context-panel) and [visibility conditions](#visibility-conditions) will be re-evaluated whenever the object
changes.

## Development

Info panels are added as part of a [package](../develop.md). There are two ways
of developing them for Datagrok: either as panel
[scripts](../../compute/scripting/scripting.mdx) or as JavaScript panel
[functions](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/functions.md). Panel scripts can be written
in any language supported by the platform (the full list of supported languages
is available [here](../../compute/compute.md#functions-and-cross-language-support)). In this
case, the main difference between the two implementations pertains to where the
code is executed. Panel functions defined in the package entry point will run on
the client side, whereas panel scripts get executed on the server.

### Visibility conditions

#### Semantic types

Sometimes it is desirable to show an info panel only for data of a specific
[semantic type](../../govern/catalog/semantic-types.md). To make use of detectors
available out of the box, simply specify a relevant semantic type either from a
script or from a panel function written in JavaScript.

```python
# name: string length
# language: python
# tags: panel
# input: string s {semType: text}
# output: int length
# condition: true

length = len(s)
```

In the above example, the input parameter has `{semType: Text}`. So when you
have a table open and go to a cell in a column with the semantic type `Text`,
you will see this panel. You can use other semantic types in a similar way, for
example, set `{semType: Molecule}` to display properties of various chemical
structures. See the full list of semantic types
[here](../../govern/catalog/semantic-types.md#automatic-semantic-type-detection).
Since the type is common to all values in a column, it is often convenient to
check it in the panel condition like this:

```Grok Script
condition: columnName.semType == "Molecule"
```

Our [JavaScript API](../packages/js-api.md) provides the means to override the types
automatically detected by the platform. Refer to this [code
snippet](https://public.datagrok.ai/js/samples/data-frame/semantic-type-detection)
as an example.

It is possible to define your own semantic types. To apply a custom detector,
first define a function that determines the corresponding semantic type in your
[detectors.js](../develop.md#package-structure) file. Then you can write a
function for auto-detection<!--, as done in our demo package [Pedometer](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/labs/tree/master/packages/Pedometer) -->.

### Scripts

To create a panel script, you should tag it as `panel` and specify conditions
for the panel to be shown in the `condition` header parameter:

```python
# name: DetectCats
# description: Detects cats on image
# language: python
# input: file file
# output: bool hascats
# tags: demo, files, panel, ml, opencv
# condition: file.isfile && file.size < 1e6 && file.path.contains("/cats/") && (file.name.endsWith("jpg") || file.name.endswith("jpeg"))

import cv2

image = cv2.imread(file)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
detector = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + "haarcascade_frontalcatface.xml")
hasCats = len(detector.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=3, minSize=(75, 75))) != 0
```

Regardless of a script's language, conditions are written in [Grok script](../under-the-hood/grok-script.md) syntax.

### Functions

A different approach is used to introduce an info panel in a JavaScript file. In
addition to the `panel` tag indication and `condition`, the function should be
properly annotated to return a widget. A simplified example is shown below:

```javascript
//name: Translation
//tags: panel, widgets
//input: file file
//output: widget result
//condition: isTextFile(file)
export function translationPanel(file) {
    return new DG.Widget(ui.divText("Lost in Translation"));
}
```

### Semantic value

There is a special type of input `semantic_value`. It is most commonly used to
preserve information about the value's context or its representation in cell.
The following code demonstrates how to get the column that contains the value.

```javascript
//name: get_column
//tags: panel, widgets
//input: semantic_value smiles { semType: Molecule }
//output: widget result
export function valueWidget(value) {
    return value ? new DG.Widget(ui.divText('column - ' + value.cell.column.name)) : new DG.Widget(ui.divText('value is empty'));
}
```
