## Test Execution

With **Test Manager**, you can easily navigate the hierarchical structure of tests to execute individual tests or categories. To run a test, use one of the following methods:

- Click the **Run** button.
- **Right-click** on the test or category and select **Run**.

Once a test has executed, the results will be displayed in the **Context Panel**, where you can review:

- **Test Status** (Success, Failure, etc.)
- **Memory Usage (`memoryDelta`)**
- **Execution Time (`ms`)**
- **UI Impact (`widgetsDelta`)**
- **Test Owner (`owner`)**

## Test Debugging

**Test Manager** makes debugging simple and efficient. Follow these steps to debug a test:

1. Select **Debug** under the **Search** input.
2. Open the **Browser Inspector (F12)**.
3. Execute the testâ€”execution will pause at the test invocation point.
4. Use **Step Into** to debug the test step by step.

This method allows you to pinpoint issues and verify test behavior effectively.

## Test Profiling

For deeper insights into test execution, **Test Manager** provides a profiling feature. Follow these steps to profile a test:

1. Open the **Browser Inspector (F12)**.
2. **Right-click** on the test and select **Profile**.
3. Navigate to the **Performance** tab in the Inspector.
4. Analyze the test execution timeline and performance metrics.

Profiling helps identify performance bottlenecks and optimize test execution times.
