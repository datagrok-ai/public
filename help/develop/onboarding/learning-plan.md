      [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datagrok-ai/public/master/packages/ApiTests/files/datasets/demog.csv)
      and import it into the platform using different approaches: drag-and-drop, double-click the "Data" icon on the
      sidebar, select "Data > Open local file", press `Ctrl+O`, and so on.
   1. [File shares](../../access/files/files.md). Add the dataset to your *Home* directory.
   1. [Databases](../../access/databases/databases.md#database-manager).
