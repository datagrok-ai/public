   * Active Directory
   * Single Sign-On
 * Authorization
    * Role- and group-based privileges
    * Dataset sharing policies
 * [Audit](../../govern/audit.md)
 * Managing [network file shares](../views/file-shares.md)
 * Managing [database connections](../../access/data-connection.md) and [queries](../../access/data-query.md)
 * Data Storage
