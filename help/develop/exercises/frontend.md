# Frontend track: exercises

The Frontend track teaches you how to create production-grade Datagrok applications. Before
proceeding to exercises, make sure you are ready for it: 

**Complete basic exercises**.

**Learn the basics of TypeScript**. The [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook)
is a great resource for that.

**Learn the [CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)**.
You should be able to use Chrome's inspector (F12), understand where elements' visual properties  
come from, create your own CSS classes, and apply selectors.

**Explore the collection of standard code snippets**. Go to [JS API examples](https://public.datagrok.ai/js),
and browse and run each snippet (F5, or '>' icon on top) under the following folders:
* `/ui`: components. Pay attention to the code, it is short and canonical, this is how you want to write your UI code.
* `/ux`: common templates for layouts, dialogs, input blocks, interactivity, navigation, etc. 
  Pay attention to the results of the snippet. 

**Set up your IDE**. You want to be as productive as possible, so this is very important.
Follow the steps outlined in the 
[Setting up the environment](exercises.md#setting-up-the-environment) section to make sure 
you can easily create, edit, and publish packages. Make sure you can debug your code with 
the assistance of IDE, including using breakpoints and code completion. 

**Know where to get help**.
