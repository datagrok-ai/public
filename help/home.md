# Datagrok: Swiss Army Knife for Data 

An end-to-end data platform for turning data into actionable insights.
Datagrok helps you unlock the value of your organization’s complex data by empowering
non-technical users to discover, cleanse, visualize, explore, model data themselves, and share 
these results. Enhance your company's ecosystem by managing connections to data, 
building data pipelines, keeping repository of domain-related scripts, and defining ontologies.
Harness the power of AI by letting computers learn from your data and your actions. 
Finally, build reusable components and domain-specific applications on top of the platform.

## Why Datagrok?

Simply put, because it's the best platform out there. We care about data, we understand science, 
technology, and how powerful modern computers are, so we went on a quest to build the perfect,
no-compromise solution. Our proprietary 
in-memory database that runs in the browser lets us process data orders of magnitudes faster 
than other products do. Interactive visualizations built on top of it are capable of working 
with billions of rows and millions of columns. Data transformations, statistical computations, 
predictive models, and custom applications are combined together as plug-and-play blocks,
allowing you to build your own blocks and enhance the ecosystem even further.     

Don't take our word for this - run the platform right now and see it yourself!
