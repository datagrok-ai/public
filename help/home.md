# Datagrok: Swiss Army Knife for Data 

A platform for turning data into actionable insights.
Datagrok helps you unlock the value of your organization’s complex data by empowering
non-technical users to discover, cleanse, visualize, explore, model data themselves, and share 
these results. Enhance your company's ecosystem by managing connections to data, 
building data pipelines, keeping repository of domain-related scripts, and defining ontologies.
Harness the power of AI by letting computers learn from your data and your actions. 
Finally, build reusable components and domain-specific applications on top of the platform.

## Why Datagrok?

Simply put, because it's the best platform out there. We care about data, we understand science, 
technology, and how powerful modern computers are, so we went on a quest to build the perfect,
no-compromise solution. Our proprietary 
in-memory database that runs in the browser lets us process data orders of magnitudes faster 
than other products do. Interactive visualizations built on top of it are capable of working 
with billions of rows and millions of columns. Data transformations, statistical computations, 
predictive models, and custom applications are combined together as plug-and-play blocks,
allowing you to build your own blocks and enhance the ecosystem even further.     

Don't take our word for this - run the platform right now and see it yourself! 

## Access

Seamlessly bring together data from the different silos and formats.

* [30+ connectors](access/data-connection.md) to all major databases
* 1,000+ services exposed via [OpenAPI](access/open-api.md)
* Drag-and-drop files to open ([10+ formats](access/importing-data.md)), or browse file shares
* [Visually explore](access/db-exploration.md) and manage relational databases using [schema browser](access/db-exploration.md#schema-browser)
  and [visual query](access/db-visual-query.md)
* Connect to [thousands of public datasets](access/public-datasets.md)
* Automate via [data preparation pipelines](access/data-pipeline.md)

## Govern

Manage availability, usability, integrity and security of your data, all in one place.

* Central [metadata](discover/metadata.md)-annotated [catalogue] of projects, queries, and connections   
* [FAIR](discover/fair.md): findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable 
* [Secure by design](govern/security.md)
* Built-in [data provenance](govern/data-provenance.md), [data lineage], [impact analysis],
  [usage analysis], and [audit](govern/audit.md) tools

## Transform

* [Aggregate, join, filter and edit data](transform/data-wrangling.md) right in the browser
* Record and apply macros
* Use 500+ available [functions](overview/functions/function.md), or write your own in R, Python, or JavaScript
* Visually edit [pipelines](transform/job-editor.md) and [query transformations](transform/recipe-editor.md)

## Explore

Our unique technology lets you explore datasets faster and more efficiently than ever, allowing to
find patterns that were previously impossible to spot, resulting in the acceleration of data-driven decisions.

* [Proprietary in-memory database](develop/performance.md) technology allows to handle tens of millions of rows in the browser
* [25+ high-performance interactive viewers](visualize/viewers.md)
* [Powerful integration with any visualizations available in R, Python, or Julia languages](visualize/viewers/scripting-viewer.md)
* Built into viewers: regression lines, confidence intervals, correlations, statistical tests 
* Automatic detection of outliers, missing values, wrong data types
* Publish dashboards 

## Learn

Turn your data into actionable insights by using state-of-the art machine learning and AI techniques. 
 
* [Train, assess, apply, share models](learn/predictive-modeling.md) 
* Use in [pipelines](transform/job-editor.md) 
* [Seamless integration with Python, R, or any other language](compute/scripting.md) 
* [Jupyter notebooks](compute/jupyter-notebook.md) 
* [Statistical Hypothesis Testing](learn/data-science.md)
* [Self-learning platform](learn/self-learning-platform.md): the more you use it, the better it gets 

## Share 

* Easily share anything with anyone, and collaborate together
* Innovate through the wisdom of crowds
* Cross-pollinate knowledge via the knowledge base, [discussions](collaborate/chat.md) and [forums](collaborate/forum.md) 
* Push ideas to users via [data augmentation](discover/data-augmentation.md)

## Apply 

* Build [custom applications] on top of the platform
* [Cheminformatics](domains/chem/cheminformatics.md)
* Text analytics
* Location Analytics 

## Deploy and Integrate 

* Different [hosting options](develop/admin/hosting-options.md) 
* [Roles, groups and privileges](govern/security.md) 
* Flexible [authentication](govern/authentication.md) 
* Create [pipelines](transform/job-editor.md), schedule [jobs](access/data-job.md), and set up [alerts](TODO:write) 
* [Customizable by IT](develop/admin/it-customizations.md)
* Easy to learn the platform using [interactive help](overview/navigation.md#help), [forums](collaborate/forum.md), [tutorials](_internal/tutorials) and [video lessons](video-lessons.md).
