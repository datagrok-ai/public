Grok is a perfect platform for building, applying, deploying, and managing predictive models
that are based on molecules.  



For cheminiformatics, Grok simplifies the process of building, applying, and deploying models
by knowing which descriptors were used for building the model 

# Training

Train a model based on a measured response, using calculated descriptors as features. Use
the built-in [model building mechanism](../../plugins/predictive-modeling.md) that supports different backends and dozens of models
with hundreds of hyperparameters available.

# Applying

[model building mechanism](../../plugins/predictive-modeling.md#apply-model)

# Augmenting

A simple yet efficient way to deploy models is to use [info panels](../../concepts/info-panels.md). This way, whenever a user
clicks on a chemical structure, or [sketches](sketcher.md) it, the predicted value will be shown in
one of the panels.
