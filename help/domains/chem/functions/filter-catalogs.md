# Filter by Catalogs

Filter by Catalogs give the ability to screen out or reject undesireable molecules
based on various criteria. 

Filter sets:
  * **PAINS** - Pan assay interference patterns. These are seperated into three sets PAINS_A, PAINS_B and PAINS_C
  * **BRENK** - filters unwanted functionality due to potential tox reasons or unfavorable pharmacokinetics
  * **NIH** - annotated compounds with problematic functional groups
  * **ZINC** - Filtering based on drug-likeness and unwanted functional groups
