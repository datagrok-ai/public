# Butina Cluster

Clustering has been described as 'the art of finding groups in data' and is widely used within the pharmaceutical
industry to design different representative sets. Most common uses of representative sets could be as training sets in the
development of different structure-activity models and for screening in different biological screens. In both cases, one
would assume that the cluster centroid is a good representative member of the corresponding cluster. It is therefore of
great importance to be able to create homogeneous clusters in a consistent way and to deal with either small or very
large sets equally well. Butina Cluster approach uses desired similarity within the cluster, as defined by Tanimoto 
index, as the only input to the clustering program.
