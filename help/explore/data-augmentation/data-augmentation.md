title: "Data augmentation"
---

_Data augmentation adds value to base data by adding information derived from internal and external sources within an
enterprise. Data is one of the core assets for an enterprise, making data management essential. Data augmentation can
help reduce the manual effort required to developed meaningful information and insight of business data, as well as
significantly enhance data quality._

One of the Datagrok's goals is to provide the relevant information to the user whenever they need it. In many cases,
that involves presenting additional augmented data without the explicit request. Here are few examples of the platform
going an extra mile, and delivering these simple insights:

* Showing quick data summary in the column tooltip
  * Histogram
  * Basic statistics
  * Highlighting missing value

## Suggesting applicable view and viewer layouts

Whenever you open a table, the platform analyzes its structure and determines whether any of the previously used
layouts (not necessarily by you) can be used to visualize that dataset. It
then [suggests these layouts to you](../../visualize/view-layout.md#layout-suggestions), even showing the preview of how
the data would look like if visualized with that layout.

## Suggesting applicable predictive models

Whenever a table is open, the platform [suggests predictive models](../../govern/catalog/self-learning-platform.md)
that can be applied to the table. Then you can predict the outcome in one click.

## Suggesting applicable actions

Using the repository of [functions](../../datagrok/concepts/functions/functions.md) (over 200+ functions), historical activity, and
the structure of the current table, the system uses AI techniques to suggest actions that are likely to be relevant at
the moment. For instance, if it finds a column that looks like street address, it will suggest to convert it to
geographical positions by doing the geo-coding and adding two columns (longitude, latitude). Or, it may suggest to
enrich the current dataset by extracting 50+ statistics associated with the location
(using US census data available on the platform).

## Manual augmentation

The suggestion mechanism is quite powerful, but oftentimes you know exactly how you want to augment the data. To get the
external data on demand, use an extensive collection of
[data connectors](../../access/access.md#data-connection). Use parameterized queries to retrieve external data for each record (or
do it on demand whenever the current record changes), and visualize the results with
[Markup Viewer](../../visualize/viewers/markup.md) for complex data, or [Form](../../visualize/viewers/form.md) for scalars.

## Info panes

[Info panes](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/info-panels.md) provide additional information about the current context (which can be a table, a column,
or any other [object](../../datagrok/concepts/objects.md)). Info panels are meant to be easily developed by the users of the
platform, and shared with other users. You can use all features of the Datagrok platform, such as scripting, data
querying and transformation pipeline, user-defined functions, markup, viewers, predictive models.

Here is an example of molecule-related info panes in action. Whenever a user clicks on a molecule, a number of info
panes get shown (collapsed by default). In a picture, we see a pane with the predicted toxicity properties, predicted
solubility, and a visualization of the atom charges. All of these results get calculated or rendered dynamically. These
info panes can be implemented externally as scripts; for instance, here is the
[source code](https://github.com/datagrok-ai/public/blob/master/packages/Chem/scripts/gasteiger_charges.py)
of the "Gasteiger Partial Charges" panel. See [public repository](../../collaborate/public-repository.md) for details on
how to contribute to the public repository of scientific functions.

## Identifiers

Datagrok allows you to easily detect and handle specific patterns in text across the platform. For example, you can configure Datagrok to recognize CHEMBL identifiers (a common format used in chemical databases) and retrieve relevant information, such as compound structures, to display in tooltips or [info panes](../../datagrok/navigation/panels/info-panels.md).

![CHEMBL_IDS](../../develop/how-to/grid/chembl-hover.png)

To register an identifier pattern and handler, follow the instructions provided [here](../../develop/how-to/grid/register-identifiers.md). Once set up, Datagrok will automatically detect, highlight and handle the identifiers in text. You can also search for the identifiers using the "Search Everywhere" feature, and Datagrok will display the relevant information in the search results.
