# Filter to Column

Saves currently filtered rows as a column.

Creates a boolean column with the specified name, where the value is set to true if the row
currently passes the filter. By default, the name of the column is populated with the description of
the current filter. Even if the name is changed, description of the current filter will be saved in
the 'Description' tag of the newly created column, and will be shown in the tooltip.
