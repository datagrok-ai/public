# Tests: Cluster data

[Clustering](cluster-data.md) is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group
(called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other

## Testing scenarios

1. Open "demog" dataset

2. Open "Cluster Data..." from  **ML | Cluster**

3. Add "Age", "Height" and "Weight" columns to field "Features"

4. Enter the number of [clusters](cluster-data.md) equal to 3 in the field "Clusters"

5. Set the value of field "Show Scatter Plot" as true

    * Column "clusters" was added to "demog" table
    * Viewer "[Scatter Plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md)" was created where [clusters](cluster-data.md) are
      marked with color

6. Click on "Cancel" button in "Cluster" dialog

    * Column "clusters" and [scatter plot](../visualize/viewers/scatter-plot.md) disappeared

7. Add all available columns to field "Features"

8. Click "OK" button

    * Column "clusters" was added to "demog" table

9. Test non-functional modules (UI, popup menu, help, navigation, properties, etc.)

    * Non-functional modules work correctly and are intuitive
